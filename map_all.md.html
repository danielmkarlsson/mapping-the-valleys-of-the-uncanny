<big>**01. Establishing a baseline**</big>    

Let's start simple. I like simple. In this text I am going to be citing other
texts. I am citing other texts partly because I think that it is a thing that
people do when they write master theses. The other part of why I'm citing other
texts is because it reminds me of sampling. I am interested in sampling. We'll
get to why I think sampling and subsequently citing other texts in this thesis
is interesting but for now it's important to me that you know why I cite. I do
it because in my mind I am actually playing back a sample. It's a sample
containing text instead of sound. You are now ready to receive my first citation.

Steve Martin wrote the script for **LA Story** and in that film he also plays the
main character Harris K. Telemacher who addresses his unrequited love this way: 

> _All I'm saying is that, when I'm around you, I find myself showing off, which
> is the idiot's version of being interesting._

When I am citing other texts I am not doing it to try to impress you. I am not
saying that I think anyone else's way of doing this is bad or anything. All I'm
saying is that, when I'm writing this, I find myself performing and in that
performing relating to ideas I have about other people's expectations. Long
story short; I guess you could say I have issues. These issues are mine. It's
not you, it's me.

Greg Egan writes in **Diaspora**:

> _Every orphan was an explorer, sent to map uncharted territory. And every orphan
> was the uncharted territory itself._

You knew this already but all of the quotes that I use could be traced back to
their origins. There you would find the rest of the body of work of that
creator. We're establishing a baseline here remember? I included the above quote
because it's from my favourite book. The reason it is my favourite book is
because it is a complete recounting of all of our yet unlived communal future,
as a utopia. I like to think that this says something about me and also about my
sensibilities. We could keep playing it this way. My liking something could be a
basis for inclusion. You might be able to piece together something towards and
understanding of my influences this way. 

Karl Marx writes in **Theses on Feuerbach**: 

> _The philosophers have only **interpreted** the world in various ways ; the point,
> however, is to **change** it._  

The above quote tells you for sure that I am at least a socialist, if you hadn't
picked up on that vibe prior to this explicit evidence. It also says something
about how I'm fond of the idea that any pattern can be broken. Anything and
everything is subject to change. The "world" here is dependent on the scope we
apply to it. You can have your pick here whether or not it is literal as in the
planet's impending demise due to capitalism-induced climate disaster and
subsequent resource wars, _or_. given the terrifying nature of that particular
avenue of thought you might prefer one of the smaller scopes. The Enlightenment,
Academia, Artistic Research within new music etc. 

I should state that I'm not attempting to put forth rigorous proof of anything.
An example of an open problem requiring rigorous proof would be something like
"Can there be a logical solution to the creation of benevolent General
Artificial Intelligence under provably safe conditions?" That would be a
Computer Science paper. This text does however aim to be of use. More on utility
later. That would probably happen on a Doctoral level (or above even?).  This is
not that. This is artistic research and as such a single collapsing of a
wavefront within a form of expression which is not yet fully formed and still
coming into being. There is quite a bit of wiggle room here and I intend to make
ample use of it because, as we'll come back to, freedoms and liberties interest me. 

I've been a composer for a while now. I've been involved with music in a lot of
different ways through the course of getting to where I'm at now, in this
moment, that has me writing this text. There have been different frameworks at
different times and those different frameworks have all come bundled with their
own set of different limitations. This kind of thing is always difficult to take
apart but I think that, at least sometimes, those limitations have inspired me.
They definitely affected the way my music sounded, that much I can tell you is
for sure. 

One way that I like to think about these frameworks is the word project.
Learning to play the guitar was a project. Learning to record myself playing the
guitar was another. Playing in a band came next. Learning to structure sound
together with friends sprung to life out of that. If we fast forward through all
of the links in the chain we arrive at the overarching project of organising
sound, and then, this particular example of that.

One fundamental difference between acoustic and electronic music is that
electronic music can be ungoverned by Newtonian forces. I think that is entirely
amazing. Any sound can arrive at any time. There need not be a sounding body or
physical object present in front of you. I hear someone in the back yelling
about speakers. Sure, sure, sure but we don't have to get stuck there.
Acousmatic music was a thing. I acknowledge that. No need to substitute one
fetichising of the corporeal with another going forward. The speaker is a
conduit, or put another way; a funnel. Thinking about it as a filter can be fun
but messy. What interests me is the stuff going through the funnel and how to
make it. 

Let's move on to what we are afforded from following the line of thinking that
we are free from the shackles of the finite and of the physical world. Sound now
enjoys morphological freedom through a myriad of transformations. It is
malleable to the utmost degree. We have at our disposal an astounding plethora
of tools through which to manipulate and organise sound. This project is a
collection of musical materials that explore the idea of the uncanny valley as
it relates to music being real, fake or some strange combination of the two.
This project is primarily one in which I produce sound files. In a secondary
capacity I am also producing a text file.

In my thesis I aim to present some of my thoughts on how my work writing code
and making music might be connected in some hopefully interesting ways to my
field. I am unlikely to be able to adequately convey my own origin myth.
Instead I'll focus on stories I've been told about music, throughout my life,
inside and outside of academia. I have a strong suspicion that these stories
have shaped my coming into being as a composer. However difficult the task of
introspection, and ultimately to know one self proves to be, I at least regard
these stories as a source for clues as to why I am driven to do the things that
I do. 

**Who is speaking?**

I don't think that there can be anything like "The Self" without others
and that "The Self" is largely about imagining other's view of yourself.

Leslie Ervine PhD, University of Colorado, writes in her Qualitative Sociology
paper **Even Better Than The Real Thing** (2000):

> _One's stories persuade one's audience that one is a particular kind of person.
> When one is one's own audience, the telling amounts to having a self._ 

What particular kind of person would I like to be? A Composer with a capital C!

> _Good stories must meet several requirements. They must fulfil their audiences

> while leaving enough ambiguity to enliven listeners imaginations._ 

This is how think about this thesis. I am doing just that drawing together of
disparate elements. Just like in a lot of music that is out there the sequence,
or the order in which things are introduced matters. A very common trait of many
musics that have been made is that they exist as a linear experience. They are a
form of artistic expression which exists within the time domain. Compare music
to sculpture. While this perhaps is not an entirely water tight example I use it
here because I use it all of the time, as anyone who knows me can attest. I am
guessing that it's important that I use it here in order to maintain
consistency. You get the idea.

> a U2 song, even better than the real thing. For listeners, stories make

I define the criteria for what a good story is to me as the following: A story
that I can remember and recount at a later time. Someone has told me a story and
I either like the story, or the person that told it to me, or both. I connect
the story to the person in my mind to varying degrees. Sometimes I end up
convinced that a particular person telling a particular story, at a particular
time, says something about what kind of person that person is, and other times
not. I think about all of the people that I have met coming up through music as
one person; Me. I was there every time someone told me a story. Those stories
undoubtedly came to shape the way I think about music and about organising
sound.

How to tell a story well is subjective or at least a matter of taste. I think
about functionality as a guide for constructing the story of the self. How
functional is it to include a certain aspect for our intended outcome? The
intended outcome here is to arrive at a story which is accessible and
comprehensible. We want to understand each other. We are looking for cues so
that we can make better guesses about future behaviour. We are looking for
patterns. We are fundamentally geared for it. It is literally hardwired into our
senses. Pattern recognition is at the core of what it means to have
consciousness. Being as musics existence is dependent on hearing and reasoning
about what we hear I could say that form exploits this pattern recognition
aspect of consciousness to keep the listener engaged and that might work with
how you view the world, maybe.

**Why should we listen?**

That common goal, as I see it, is organizing sound. This makes us the same you
and I. Mostly everyone we know shares this common goal. I trace this way of
thinking about our common goal back to Edgard Varese talking about his own music
as organised sound. I am fine with that description. It is a very broad and
inclusive way of thinking about what we are doing, all of us together as a
group. I want to keep finding new answers to the question of how to organise
sound in ways that continue to interest me. Part of my staying interested is
engaging with other people who are also engaged in this same struggle. I want to
be part of a Community.

I've thought a lot about how to set myself up so that I become increasingly
unlikely to get bored. Cutting myself of from people increases the risk of
getting bored. Sharing my tools increases the likeliness of contact and/or
stimulating communication with other people.

I don't just want to talk _at_ people about my internal state. I genuinely want
to try to make an honest attempt to make my thesis valuable to others in terms
of it's utility. This is why I've chosen to include my code. My thinking here is
that there exists a certain kind of reader that won't want to sit through these
touchy feely meanderings unless there is a promise of some code that can be run
at the end of the day. Here is that promise now.
 
I couldn't resist tying back sharing the code into this project's narrative
framework as maps. You would be free to connect my code to anything you want and
control it. You could make your own connections to the things you care about.
Edit my code to find your own path through the valley. 

**What's wrong?**

Analogies are a special category of story. They are frail things. I don't
particularly care for them as I find that they too easily fall prey to being
contradicted by themselves as all of the things are fundamentally different from
each other. For example it doesn't work to say that gravity is kind of like a
rubber band pulling you back to the earth when you jump up. This falls apart
because the rubber band is also subjected to gravity within that analogy. 
When analogy is used to describe domains that we kind of "know" are at least a
little fuzzy and or subjective like emotions and ways of thinking poetically
about the world then I think that can be understood as something akin to a
shorthand and receives a passing grade. Now, with all that in mind, here comes an
analogy: Certain sonorities always made me feel like I was on the outside of a
locked door. Which sonorities I mean are largely exemplified in the music I made
for this project.

Having picked the lock or otherwise bypassing it (perhaps metaphysically walking
through walls) I am now inside the room. Inside the room are a bunch of fancy
instruments that can be computer controlled. It is an amazing room and I am very
happy that I can enter into it whenever I want and spend as much time there as I
like. No one ever comes into the room to say that "Who the hell are you? You
can't be in here touching these ~~instruments~~ priceless museum pieces!
Security!!" I am in a safe space now and that feels good. The thing that feels
even better is that I got in by thinking about how to get in using the tools
available to me. Boom! I fixed my problem. I don't have a problem anymore. I
should be happy now right? Nope. That's not how this works. I find struggle
wherever I go. I keep going. Trying new things.

Here is an example of the frailty I was talking about earlier. You wouldn't be
particularly well served by bringing the wrong map with you on a hiking trip in
the woods. That wouldn't be poetic, you would just regret it. I much prefer
diagrams to analogies. So much more serious seeming and they have that sweet,
sweet science feel to them.

**The Cyber is huge**

Trying to make sense of what music making is and what subsequent publishing as
cybernetic practice means all seems very difficult, so let's use a tool to help
us do that thinking.

Stephen Willats is a British artist who has self-published Control magazine,
a seminal forum for artists´ writings on art practice and social organization
since 1965. I'm going to let Willats walks us through the diagram and I'll
add some thoughts:

> _This diagram shows the position an art work traditionally occupies between the artist
> and [vis] audience. Two fundamental discrete [cognitive] loops are shown, which are
> isolated from each other by the art work. There is no form of interaction
> between the two which could generate mutual understanding as would be the case
> in a successful conversation. In the absence of such a procedure both the
> audience and artist become locked in their own perceptual biases._

The audience views the result of the artist's process of composing the work and
then goes on about their lives. Both artists and the audience go on to make and
experience new artworks. The arrows keep on going up forever like on a conveyor
belt infinitely churning out new artworks to be experienced. Some particular
work by some particular artist may resonate more with some individual human
being held within the mass that is the audience. The prescribed modus operandi
for this individual is then to take an interest in the artist, or rather the
story that has been constructed about the artist. To be neatly consumed, perhaps
in the form of a biography or an interview. I don't think this model serves us
very well. At least not on it's own.

> _I wanted to look at all means of communication within society to take what I
> could from everywhere I could, and reformulate it into a new way of
> operating._

This makes me think of sampling thought of as an act which holds potential to be
radically instrumental both in reevaluating not just intellectual property laws
but the very concept of property itself. 

> _I wanted to intervene in the fabric of society directly. Not just sit inside a
> box, but to move freely within the interpersonal infrastructure of society. To

If we were to share our code the audience is more likely to be empowered to do
something other than to continue to go about their lives as consumers. Consumers
of musics and of stories about artists. Perhaps idolizing them. Putting the
artist and subconsciously the idea that they themselves as part of an audience
(which is wholly separate from the artist) could create something, anything.

> Transformation in the self, or creative potential of the self, so that anybody

> community._

I think self-organization as Willats uses it above is problematic because it
could be misconstrued as the invisible hand of the market which needs to be left
alone forever in order to self-organize supply and demand of goods and services.
Luckily for me there is a license that explicitly negates that. It's GPLv3.  The
specific transformation in the self that I'm aiming at changing is attitudes
towards constructed narratives designed to create cult followings. They are not
helping to deepen the audience's relationship with the artwork. Giving the
audience access to the GPLv3 licensed code on The Public Internet might not do
that all of the time but it is a thing to try instead of going along with a
prescribed method mindlessly. 

> _... there was an interconnection between the audience, the language, the meaning,

I've had a bunch of experiences prior to working on this project. I have made
and heard a whole lot of music. Not only that but basically everything that has
ever happened to me and the things that I have come to believe, about myself and
about the world, I take with me into this new project. That happens with every
project. The framework surrounding this particular project really make me very
aware of that. Same thing goes for a listener. They also bring everything with
them into the act of listening. They might not know it but that's how it is.
Nothing happens in a vacuum. The two discrete loops of the artist and audience
are still kept separate in other necessary ways. I need to create music to keep
myself balanced but that doesn't mean that I surrender my privacy. The listener
shouldn't have to either. Privacy is growing concern. Especially on the
internet.

The Public Internet and the commercial internet are two very different places.
I thought for sure that once we got decent speeds going for most folks (yes, in
the global west, I know) we'd see some great stuff happening for distribution.
Self publishing web sites and genuine communication between all kinds of folks
leading to all kinds of profound new insights in all kinds of domains. Instead
we got social media and all kinds of really terrible things happening.

I am connecting back to earlier where I talked about how sampling is something I
think we can stand to come back to. The infrastructure we use for getting things
done on The Public Internet is something we need to look both forwards but also
backwards in order to make sense of. Social media platforms or any other part
of the commercial internet is not a part of that. 

Brass tax nomenclature:

• Self published web sites <br>
• RSS <br>
• Email (lists)

These three apply to everyone. This last one is most important to music makers:

• A decent media player

When I say decent I mean that the audio quality is decent (320kbs constant bit
rate for audio and video). I also mean that artists are in control of their own
content and not supplying a platform with free content to attract listeners
which then get bombarded with ads.

**02. Uncanniness**

It can mean a lot of different things.  
Let's have a look in a dictionary:  

- Having or seeming to have a supernatural or inexplicable basis.  
- Beyond the ordinary or normal.  
- Extraordinary. 

"Uncanny accuracy; An uncanny knack of foreseeing trouble."

- Mysterious.  
- Arousing superstitious fear or dread.  
- Uncomfortably strange.  

"Uncanny sounds filled the house."    

Let me make an attempt at explaining why am I drawn to it. First off it strikes
me as contemporary seeing as we are all living through post truth and secondly
because I regard it as largely unexplored when thought of as a musical
parameter. It turns out originality, or otherness is important to me.

Uncanniness looks unexplored enough as a space to peek my interest. From where
I'm standing uncanniness being largely unexplored is true. This pespective is
something that I have created via the act of viewing and thinking about the
world. In a time of post-truth simply having a thought and then remembering that
you have had it can lead one to thinking it is a true statement on par with
statements like: Gravity exists! At the time of writing the so called leader of
the free world has behaved this exact way countless times. Strange times indeed. 

Practical example of how I've come to think of uncanniness as a musical
parameter within the scope of this project: Say I want to write some music for
strings. There are many sample libraries to choose from. So it's which one I
choose, first off, but it goes deeper. These libraries all exist on a spectrum
ranging from authentic sounding to blatantly fictitious. It interests me to
think about where a particular library lands on that spectrum for an imagined
listener. After that there are aspects of how a library is recorded and
scripted that influence me to make all kinds of choices regarding the
construction of the music. Dynamics and registration most especially but in some
cases even pitch material has revealed itself to me through this lens.  

It has been inspiring to read about Masahiro Mori's thoughts about [The Uncanny
Valley](https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/humanoids/the-uncanny-valley)
and through that finding [Bunraku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunraku). It
has impacted my view of the world and about how reality is something we all hold
together by reenacting. We are constantly reminding each other of how to behave
and what to regard as real and what to discard as unreal. Or as William Gibson
put it in Neuromancer: 

> _A consensual hallucination._ 
>

Gibson was talking about something a little different when he wrote that. That's
part of what interests me about sampling. We can both refer to, and at the same
time recontextualize anything that has previously been recorded, either as sound
or as text. When we quote text we are bringing the context of academia at least
and perhaps even of The Enlightenment with us. We are standing on the shoulders
of giants. Literally all of recorded history. Kept safe for us so that we might
learn from it. With sampling of audio it's a little different. Intellectual
property laws forbid it. You would have to get permission from the rights
holders to distribute a derivative work. You would most likely have to give away
all of your potential profit to them. How does artists receiving fractions of
pennies per stream impact this?  How does listeners having access to "all" of
the music ever recorded impact this? We know it can't be "all" of it, but alas,
that is how it is marketed.

As my work of organizing sound has led me further and further down the path of
algorithmic composition I have grown more and more interested in the role of
contexts and connotations that certain sounds bring about in an audience. I
never really had any deeper context for LinnDrum claps or Four Operator FM
Synthesis. No contexts that I regarded as my own except for the obvious context
that these sounds are strictly out of bounds for anyone looking to make serious
music. While that forbidden quality still holds some titillation I have moved on
to thinking that for the most part; No one cares. Don't worry. This is a good
thing. Trust me. It means that we are free. Free to dream endlessly and to make
anything we want. Absolutely free. Steve Martin wrote about this in **LA Story**:

> _...no one is looking to the outside for verification that what they're doing
> is ok._

Getting back to the practical; Certain things are different when sequencing
sounds in a computer. Sounds can be played faster. That's interesting because we
have that faster playing in music played by humans also. It's interesting because
a lot of the time it gets held up as virtuosic in different ways in different
genres. We use phrases like gifted or talented musicians. A computer can play
_exactly_ the same amplitude and timbre multiple times in a row. Humans can't,
well actually the constraint is higher up than that. Simple physics, Newtonian
forces won't allow it. We've never held that kind of virtuosity up as
equilibristic instrumentalist practice. I don't think we'd react quite the same
way if a human got even remotely close. "You sound like a machine" they'd say.
It would be derogatory. They might not even know what machine they'd be
referring to. It would be the sampler and more specifically an early days
sampler with a single layer of samples. No round-robin switching out of the
samples to mimic what happens "naturally" when a key is struck on a Steinway at
different velocities. An infinite amount of the subtlest variation explodes out
of that action each time. The cross talk inside the body of the instrument as
multiple keys are struck elevate the richness of timbral interplay to
immeasurable heights of exponentiality.

**03. The notion of The Real**



I find my own thinking aligning with parts of Slavoj Zizek's in The Reality of
the Virtual but _only_ the parts I chose to quote. Just so that we are clear on
that. My quoting Zizek is not an infinite endorsement of all of the
things he has said in the past and will say in the future. Going straight to
Lacan for thoughts on Lacan is not an option for me: 

> _...when I deal with you, I'm basically not dealing with the real you. I'm
> dealing with the virtual image of you. And this image has reality, in the sense
> that it, none the less, structures the way I am dealing with you. And then
> this idealization is crucial._ 

I substitute the interactions of two individual human beings with an audience's
experiencing of an artwork. I also feel that idealization is crucial within this
project as well. Had there not been this idealized view of acoustic instruments
then there would be no foundation to build my castles in the sky upon. I am
trying to relate to my surroundings somehow by creating these works.

> _This would be the first elementary level: Imaginary virtual, in the sense of
> the virtual image which determines how we interact with other people. Virtual
> image in the sense of: Although we interact with real people, we erase, we
> behave as if whole strata of the other person are not there._

I here substitute "real people" with artworks and "the whole strata" as the
process which has led to the result that is the artwork; The file. The .wav 
or .pdf for example. Process and method or even just the nomenclature of the
tools involved are per default hidden or made secret.

An example of a virtual symbolic belief in our neck of the woods would be the
story of how Gil Evans arranged Sketches of Spain. The story goes that he's a
genius for arranging in such a way that instruments that were very widely apart
in terms of their audibility, were they to be stood on a stage together, could
be made to fit snugly in a mix. Contrastingly there's the story of how a 1930s
first-timer studio musician asked a recording engineer if there oughtn't be more
than one microphone in the room. The recording engineer then proceeds to laugh
and ask if the musician intends to record more than one record simultaneously?
The recording engineer goes on to explain that whomever in the ensemble has a
solo should take a step closer to the microphone. 

I presuppose that there is a person within an audience which listens to the
result of my organizing of sound filtered through these stories even tho I don't
regard them as real from my perspective. I imagine an audience's a priori
established beliefs subsequent effect on their perception of artworks that I
produce. 

In the music that I have produced for this project the presupposition of the
imagined audience is that acoustic music is created by living breathing human
beings reading sheet music. They are using a very special type of physical
object which is a musical instrument to make sounds. Ideally this happens in a
special type of physical space which is a concert hall. This is how recordings
get made. The details surrounding the engineering aspect of the recording is not
important. The people in the room with their instruments; That is where the
magic happens. Any infringement upon that fact is unthinkable to this imagined
audience which holds these virtual beliefs. This then becomes Zizek's efficacity
as it gave me something to relate to when I made the music for this project.

In the lead up to Zizek's great reveal of The Real Real there is the telling of
the story in which Rumsfeld lists what they knew at the time just before the war
on Iraq:

- The known knows
- The know unknowns
- The unknown unknowns


Zizek adds a fourth category to Rumsfeld's list: 

- Unknown knowns

"We know them, they are part of our identity, they determine our activity, but we don't
know that we know them! This is what, in psychoanalysis, of course, is called
unconscious. Unconscious fantasies, unconscious prejudices, etc., etc. And I
think that this level is crucial."

I agree that this level is crucial and add that biases are another wording of
how these unknown knows dictate our behaviour. This wording strongly comes
into focus for me as an expression of contemporality. Especially as it relates
to how a wider applicability of algorithms in our daily lives has led to
questions being raised about algorithmic bias. Stating the obvious here for the
record: All of the algorithms created to date have been created by humans. We are
the one's writing the algorithms. These are our biases. We bring them with us
into everything we do. Even into the act of listening to music. This is part of
why I was drawn to exemplifying or possibly even teasing out these biases or
unknown knows in the music I made in this project.

The Lacanian Triad according to Zizek

That which resists symbolization

“The real is what resists symbolization absolutely.” ― Jacques Lacan, The
Seminar of Jacques Lacan: Freud's Papers on Technique

Heightened states of being, as in the impossibility of hearing a multitude of
things sounding in a multitude of spaces, at a multitude of different times all at
once. Transcending limitations of time and space through non realTime
assemblage. 

"...through layers of diminishing reality"  

"...half-awake, unable to distinguish the virtual from the real"  
The two above quotes taken from: 
[How much of the internet is fake?](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/12/how-much-of-the-internet-is-fake.html)

Philip K. Dick's "Counterfeit unrealites" is a collection of four novels.
Undoubtedly the most known of which is "Do androids dream of electric sheep" which was
later adapted into Blade Runner.

In Baudrillard's Simulation and Simulacra there are four categories:

- Faithful copy
- Mask
- Illusion
- Pure simulacrum

**04. The MPC is now a lens**

  

If the tape recorder was hyperReal then the MPC is hyperHyperReal
(compare postPostModern) and controlling Kontakt with SuperCollider is
infinitely hyperRealised in comparison to the original origin story.  

When the myth of our origin (specifically Electronic Music's origin myth) is
told through the perspective of the tape recorder being the start. Then later
the tape recorder grows to the size of the studio with undeniable monumental
prestige. If we adjust the point of departure to a more recent technological
breakthrough then the scope of our story changes dramatically. To use the MPC as
the starting point for an alternative telling of history emerges as an
opportunity.  

The story we now construct has ramifications for where density occurs. My
preference would be for it to occur closer to our time. Preferably in the now.
Year zero is no longer 1930 with that of the Americans liberating the tape
recorder from the rubble of nazi Germany. Instead the year is 1988. Public Enemy
burst into a popular culture running at break-neck-speed with their debut
release **It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back**. Our origin story is
no longer one of first meanderings of applying an alien technology inside of a
void. Instead the very modus operandi is referentiality. The sampler and
sampling, not the tape recorder and tape recordings. 

The history of Electronische Musik begins with the tape recorder and then
explodes outward into the physical monument of the studio. Our new origin story
is one of implosion. Both stories originate from a single machine.  

Sampler software inside of computers are direct descendants of the MPC. They now
have no physical form. They are software. The computer disappears into
generalization. A computer can perform the task of any specialized machine like
the tape recorder or the sampler. A general purpose computer. Incorporeal.
Purpose defined in software.

It wasn't until much later that I realised that the magical machine that I had
heard about was the MPC. I first heard the story when I was a kid listening to
NWA, Public Enemy, De La Soul. Then finally when I was older from a guy who
showed me J-Dilla's Donuts. He told me the story as we were listening to the
album together. It was interleaved. The story was. It got interrupted by "oh oh
and check this part out". Little things about the production.  Details. They say
the devil is in the details. Anyway I really got that story handed to me. The
last celebrated experimental hip hop record. Didn't have any rapping on it.  The
story goes he made it in the hospital as he was dying of a terminal illness.
Had his MPC on his belly in the hospital bed. I don't know if that's true. I
guess I've put off trying to find out if it's true because I like the story.

> A kiss may not be the truth but it's what we wish were true. 
>

That bit is from Steve Martin's **LA Story**. In the movie I think we're meant to
think it's a Shakespeare quote. I very much enjoy how in the film there are
all kinds of subtleties at work drawing lines between high and low expressions
of culture.

There might be a way to way to fit the John Cage on tour in Europe with Earl
Brown and Christian Wolff story in here. The story goes that they were all on
tour together and their musics all utilized the idea that if there is a
sufficient amount of silence in between notes then the listener will forget the
previous note. John Cage finds that after hearing the same program being played
night after night in city after city he begins to hear melodies in all of their
pieces. Prolonged exposure. Even just practice. It ends up in your memory even
if you don't want it to. Cage focused on just the notes in this example. To my
mind there would have still been the compounded infinities of timbre and timing.
With the MPC in it's first iteration I'm thinking this was most apparent. Hit
that pad and get exactly the same sound every time. Later models in my time have
been marketed as having velocity through pressure sensitivity built into the
pads. Not sure but I think they returned to the flat no dynamics when they
made an iOS version. The MPC is then an expression of  acorporeality as Egan
uses the word in **Diaspora**, reduced to pictures under glass. The
retriggering anyway. The "machineGunning". That's what I think became what made
the MPC so interesting in how it was perceived. Lifeless, or even undead, like a
zombie. The corpse moves, and in such marvellously different ways.

Sampling as a radical act? Here then maybe the idea that there were
possibilities presented to artists in the past (a very special brush) that for
whatever reason have been insufficiently explored. Paradoxically taking on the
role of the old hat at the same time. FM certainly is like that. Additive
synthesis as well. These two examples can easily be thought of through a purely
technical perspective. Since both FM and additive synthesis offer an apparent
abundance in the parameter space it becomes a problem of organizing efforts to
explore them in powerful (abstracted) ways. We are left to our own devices here.
We are not posing a threat to anyone noodling around inside of our belly buttons
engaging with this work. On the other hand sampling isn't comparatively as
underexplored from a technical perspective. Might could be that there could be a
case to make about how sampling could be underexplored from a referential and
social perspective. This is largely due to how fraught with legal concerns
sampling became. There was, I think, a panic that spread quickly. A scrambling
then ensued to safeguard intellectual property belonging to large corporations.

**06. Pine cones are magical**

(I'd like to change your mind about everything you know in your heart of hearts
to be true) 

Up is down. Right is wrong. While I don't believe in actual magic I find this
passage from Jarod Anderson's The CryptoNaturalist useful for purposes of
illustration:

> Pine cones are beautiful, geometric wonders that are only devalued by their
> abundance. Fractal sculptures. Evergreen snowflakes. Blossoms in wood.
> (Familiarity can rust magic. A little mental effort returns the shine.)" 

I would like to return the shine, as it were, to the task of organising sound in
general and to working with algorithmic composition in particular. 
Stretch goals would be to influence people to join me in rewiring the term
Computer Music to hold a new meaning. One tailored specifically to fit our time.
As computers are no longer held in artificial scarcity but rather available in
abundance new ways of thinking and acting in the world are possible.

<br>
<br>

**Oram's new Atlantis** 

I keep coming back this passage from Francis Bacon's The New Atlantis which was
first published in 1623:

> "We have also sound-houses, where we practise and demonstrate all sounds, and
> their generation. We have harmonies which you have not, of quarter-sounds, and
> lesser slides of sounds. Divers instruments of music likewise to you unknown,
> some sweeter than any you have, together with bells and rings that are dainty
> and sweet. We represent small sounds as great and deep; likewise great sounds
> extenuate and sharp; we make divers tremblings and warblings of sounds, which in
> their original are entire. We represent and imitate all articulate sounds and
> letters, and the voices and notes of beasts and birds. We have certain helps
> which set to the ear do further the hearing greatly. We have also divers strange
> and artificial echoes, reflecting the voice many times, and as it were tossing

> some deeper; yea, some rendering the voice differing in the letters or
> articulate sound from that they receive. We have also means to convey sounds in
> trunks and pipes, in strange lines and distances.”

That's some story. Actually, for me it's a story wrapped in another story.
Daphne Oram put that quote on the wall at The BBC Radiophonic Workshop and
_that's_ the story I've been told.

Take your fingers right up to your ears. As close as you can get them without
touching your ears. Now rub your fingers together ever so gently. You can hear
that can't you. Now imagine trying to hear such a faint sound across from a
concert hall or even just a stage. You would not be able to. Now imagine an
orchestra. Something close to a hundred people. They wouldn't be able to fit
there with all of their instruments in that close proximity where you heard that
faint sound of your fingers rubbing together just now. Right there is where I
put the microphone. Each time, as close as I can get it. It's the place were a
lover whispers to you. For each instrument and sometimes even changing the
placement to optimize fully for a particular articulation. We are taught that
close proximity is dangerous and can lead to an exaggerated low end. I feel it is
easier and sounds better to subtract from a signal rather than add to it and
anyone who knows that I have a strong preference for the lower end of the
spectrum. If need be cut the bass and add a room, any room, later. Get as much
of the signal as you can when you have it. Just make sure it doesn't clip.

<br>
<br>

**07. Rooms are resonant bodies**

( Ties into place.
The absurdity and poetic nature of us imagining someone having
believed that a photograph could steal a soul. ) 

I've come to understand that my fascination for room tones is connected to my
confusion about my class identity. Mimer first. I didn't realize it at the time.
And then later, The Machine Hall in Ställberg. It was right under my nose then
but it took me quite a while to piece the puzzle together. It's impossible for
the narrative component of which space I use to travel the distance to the
listener on it's own. For me it's different. I know the name of the convolution
file. I can imagine the workers there. Through a wrinkle in time. Working,
ceaselessly, dutifully. And now that the lightning has been caught in the bottle
I can imagine that work filling that room with sound. From the lowest rumbles
through the spectrum all the way up the ladder to the harshest height of the
audible spectrum. At the end of it we subtract time and we've captured if not
the room itself then it's essence, or if you care to indulge me, it's soul. My
fascination has been focusing in on trying to pin down the work that happened
there. It can't be saved for later and understood given enough time. My origin
story will always elude me. If these walls could talk we say. My thoughts
connect things up and make patterns. Compare another cavernous room tone; The
church. A place of worship. A place to wonder in awe of god's greatness. The
organ was the first big organised sound. That room is part of how we've heard
that instrument. The resonance. Place and narrative intersect in the tone of the
room. As the room resonates we are brought into resonance with ideas. I never
believed in god. I never believed that narrative. I know work was real. The
workers were real. Their struggle was real. I believe in that narrative.

Place: Make the case that a piece of code can be thought of as sculpture or as a
place. What are some examples of nice places? The stone garden is a nice story.
The shopping mall is another place. Not as nice a place I don't think. Then
again, I've never experienced a stone garden. The stone garden only exists in my
imagination through having been told stories.

<br>
<br>

**08. State is immeasurable**

The code is static. Why is that important? The frozen state yielding a multitude
of infinities in variation through time fascinates me. Always has. To construct
something and then for it to take on a life of it's own in a sense. Feels
paradoxical. This then goes on to say something interesting about complexity. The
scope or sampling window matters. Static or in flux. Has to do with the
presentation aspect. I work on the code until it reaches a static state which is
most to my liking. While I might not listen to an eternity's worth of the
generated material I'll listen to a good long while. I can be certain that the
algorithms combining of parameters will satisfy me in the same way that I can
hear when a piece is finished. My choice to project static code in combination
with fixed media is for the greater part due to my fascination for complexity
emerging out of simplicity. To a smaller degree I cant help but go against the
prescribed modus operandi of playing the code within so called live coding like
an instrument. That is not what I want to do. I want to organise sound in a very
specific way. Another nice aspect of static code is that it greatly increases
portability.

We're not ready for it. I don't mean that live coding is so futureWorld that it
as a phenomenon is ahead of it's time. What I'm saying is that we don't have the
fundamentals of the infrastructure for even just the creation of the kind of
files that can be distributed in a way that makes sense. Video is a really bad
way of making code available to others. The recipient can't copy the code out of
it and has to write it by hand. This is error prone and clunky. Also the file
sizes are huge. Static code however is just a tiny text file. Kilobytes. Goes
anywhere fast because it is so tiny.

I got to thinking about state a lot through brushing up against functional
programming. State is thought of as something dirty and dangerous there in that
scene then that makes it interesting to me. I found workarounds because it was
fun to go against prescribed ways of working. Also I'd argue that memory is a
fundamental aspect of music as it is a time based medium. You can't say stuff
like "There is no state" or that "Time is the only constant" and not expect
people to rebel.

Anyway the whole wanting to stay one hundred percent squeaky clean all of the
time thing that can happen to functional programmers always struck me as having
more to do with fundamental problems in computer science than about me wanting
to organise sound. Never mind about all of that. I don't mind so much that there
could potentially be a danger of some unexpected behaviour when I'm making music
by writing code. I do a lot more listening to results than than I do expecting
to hear things. So long as it makes a sound there is something for me to hear
and, most importantly, to decide what I think of it. I only ever regarded
unintended silence as failure. Anything above that is something I can work with.
If I can hear it I am certain that I can decide if I like it or not. How could I
not have an opinion on anything and everything I hear? As far back as I can
remember that's all I've been doing. Deciding. Making choices based on what I've
been hearing. So it's real simple. I like simple. So does Mark Fell and I like
Mark Fell.

Mark Fell had this to say in Phillip Clark's Manitutshu Wire Review:

> It's all dead simple, I have no real interest in technical complexity, and this
> music has a streamlined quality I admire. No gesture is strained or wasted and
> the music is complex, the technology is simple, a better way round than the age
> old problem of academic electronic music where muscular technology too often
> produces pissweak sounds.

If I try hard I can still remember that the task of organising sound felt
daunting to me in the beginning. I would think about the infinite possibilities
of combinatorics and a general dread of the blank page would sneak up on me and
I'd get all wound up. I like to keep things simple. Usually I don't notice that
I've started composing for real until much later. I thought I was just trying to
figure out how something worked. I change one thing at a time, and I listen. If
I like what I hear, having tweaked that one parameter, I'll move on to the next
one. Complexity could yield itself later through the compounding of many simple
choices. I don't go after complexity. I don't shy away from it either. It could
happen and that would be ok so long as I like what I'm hearing. Simple. Reduced
both in terms of thinking about emergence of complexity and also about the work
as just another craft. Do a thing many times in order to get apt at doing
that thing.

**09. The Believing Game**

When I was a kid I would sometimes stare for long stretches of time at high
ceilings imagining what it would be like to be in that upside down world in the
ceiling. To walk around up there, looking up at the world down here. For
everything to be so different, about the way we perceive this place, where we
are now. You are reluctant to have your perspective changed. Your world views
are pretty much set. Let's play a game you and I. It's called: The Believing
Game.

**10. Music is a technology**

The title of this section is a remix of Anthony Rother's 2005 album **Art is a
technology**. I liked that album. Apart from the way it sounded and how that
made me feel I liked it because it was at once the most prominent example of
Modular Music and at the same time managed to transcend the genre entirely.

On April 6th of 2019, at Fylkingen, in Stockholm, I premiered a bunch of music
that I had made during the last year or so. I made a lot of little choices about
the details surrounding this manifestation of the work. This compounding of
little choices is very important to me. You've heard the expression The Devil is
in the details. I subscribe to that idea fully.

My first concious choice was that I wrote code in order to make all of the
pieces. I want to participate in recontextualizing the term Computer Music.
This term comes from a time where computers where rare and the direction of this
scarce resource towards the goal of making music even rarer. At the time of this
writing computers are ubiquitous.

There where three sets. I've been a part of a lot of shows and I have
found that this format is my preference. Each set was 40 minutes and there were
two 20 minute breathers in between the sets. I find that this makes it doable
from a technical perspective. Longer and or more sets are not my preference
within this **Fylkingen Show framework**.

I choose to do the show on a Saturday afternoon. My thinking there was that I
wanted it to be possible for a person who works a full time job with regular
hours to attend. I chose the afternoon instead of the default evening time
because I didn't want to have the bar open. The reason I didn't want to have
the bar open is because I don't drink. I also didn't want to sell anything. I
also find that the default behaviour of everyone drinking at shows is not
conducive to listening. Also there is the larger issue of sustainability.

The sound files I created where all Stereo sound files. They were diffused in a
larger speaker system by Mats Erlandsson. The width of the Stereo files were
enhanced and the music really came to life and filled the room. Mats tailored
the colour and amplitude of each component piece to the particular responses of
the room. The sound files were accompanied by projection of the code I used to
make the particular piece.

**11. The Impossibility of The Maps**

> Nothing is real, everything is permitted.[^syntax] 
>

[^syntax]The source for this is acknowledged by William S. Burroughs himself in
Minutes to Go, p. 61: Nothing is true all is permitted. Last words [of] Hassan
Sabbah. The Old Man of the Mountain quoted from The Master of the Assassins by
Betty Bouthoul. 

The quote keeps popping up. Later on in a video game called Assassin's Creed.
Everyone is sampling it. The origin is more blurred by every use of it. It
especially affects searchability on The Public Internet as the search engine
(you know which one, the dominant one) is "optimizing" by finding and fanning
flames into resonances. When a resonance becomes feedback it can be used as a
signal. True origins get overwritten.

Adam Phillips says that

> The only satisfactions available are the satisfactions of reality, which are

Preferences of style exist, aesthetics do not. Just as there is no god there can
be no divine beauty. We are left to our own devices down here. We have to make
up our own minds about what we prefer.

So the gist of this text is this: During my Master which was 2017 to 2019 I
changed my way of working with music in a few different ways. Part of it was
changing out the tools I used. I regard nomenclature as an important first step
towards transparency. I went from using TidalCycles to using SuperCollider. From
using SuperDirt as my sampler to instead using Kontakt. From using AudioMulch to
using Reaper for doing real time post production. So some of the names of the
tools changed but the functionality broadly speaking stayed the same. The modus
operandi is still: Write code that triggers samples and then apply effects in
some kind of DAW-like environment in order to express my musical ideas. Why
should I express my musical ideas? Because I want to and because I can. The
possibility exists and I am drawn to it. The way I make music is dependant on
tools. The tools should be open for others to study and use. If I don't take
measures to make my tools available to others then I am kicking out the rungs
beneath me as I climb upward. This is a process which has not by any means
reached. I am embarrassed by my dependence on commercial software. It should all
be open source by now but it isn't. I make excuses, none of which are any good,
for why I am not fully open source. My most commonly used excuse is that I am
pressed for time.

On a conceptual or extra musical level I am obliged to admit, however
reluctantly, that something changed. Anyone who knows me is always hearing me
tell the same story. About how fundamentally music is incapable of depicting
anything because of the fact that it is inherently abstract and utterly
ephemeral. Despite of how many times I have told that story both to myself, to
my friends and basically anyone within earshot I ended up making a strange kind
of programme music myself. I got to thinking, perhaps too much, about my
environment and about the people I met there. How they work and also about why
they work in the ways that they work. What their goals are. The project ended up
describing my thoughts and emotions about being back in that old world. Feeling
much the same way as before. Like a thief at a cocktail party, trying to blend
in, eating hors d'oeuvres and failing to exchange pleasantries, sweating
profusely, certain of being found out and subsequently thrown out, any second
now. 

I've learned a lot from working on this project. It's been very freeing in a lot
of ways. I feel like I got over myself in some ways. Also I dug down deep and
pushed through some issues. I spent a lot longer coming back to pieces adding to
and changing things about them. I know that doesn't matter though. What I mean
to say is: No one can ever hear how long any piece of music took to write. How
much effort went into making it. How much struggle. How many demons overcome.
Sound is just wiggly air. It is also my favourite thing to do with the time that
I have. Also I don't think I'm hurting anyone. So that's what I'm doing. Making
the air wiggle in a particular way that interests me here in the right now.

Ultimately this project is about learning to cope with cognitive dissonance.
After Drumpf[^syntax] was elected I had a real personal crisis. The world had
entered an era of post truth.

**Below are unsorted snippets of random things**

If you are doing creative work then to some extent, sure, I think it could be a
good idea to try to write down some of your thoughts about the task at hand from
your perspective. 

What's that quote about how the originality of your ideas being dependent on
the obscurity of your sources?

What is the utmost of subtlety?

The Vivaldi was a publisher story. The unlikeliness that program music will be
real. Most likely a marketing ploy to peddle goods of some kind. In Vivaldi's
time sheet music was the product. I remember the time in my life when as a
teenager I would go to a record store to listen to music and decide which CD I
would buy. I could afford to buy one per CD month. I was building my collection
slowly this way. Then later because a lot of strange and complicated reasons I
started lend/leasing compressed files through a platform. I did this through
monthly subscription which coincidentally is the same amount I paid for the one
CD a month. They say you can listen to any music through this platform but I
know that's not true. The platform being there and seeming so very
unquestionable has led to people attempting to game it. The blandest, most chill
music is being made in the hopes that it will be included in playlists marketed
as containing the best music to sleep to. The ultimate state of utility for
music which is then to be unheard, at least consciously. It would be there to
sooth and lul you back to sleep if it was interrupted perhaps is the thinking.
When fractions of pennies per play are offered to artists by the all encompassing
platform then whole nights worth of plays is where the money is. Especially
when you multiply it by the platform preferring to peddle the good that is the playlist by
use of algorithms. The data aggregated from the entirety of the platform's users
dictates that this is the most chill music to sleep to. The resonance is
inevitable. Feedback eventually rips everything apart. Ouroboros clenches it's own
tail, spiralling ever downward in convolution and the most chill unfelt agony
that is never learning of the great width and breadth of the provable infinite
capacity for variety that music holds.

Artificiality can be devastating. 

Surface. 
Superficiality. 
Appearances. 
Representation. 
Displacement. 
Fabricated narratives. 
Performative acts. 
Blurring the line between the real and the fake.
A faint sound in an adjacent room.
The meta physical. 
Beyond the pleasure principle.
The old world is lost (reprise)
The steepness of the pyramid

Money pays salaries, funds nonprofits, buys art, funds grants. Does it matter
where it comes from? What makes certain money acceptable or not acceptable? Is
it: How it was made? Who it comes from? What is given in return? What it is
going towards? Our ethics and internal math may vary, but the question is
omnipresent.

Tell the story of how you heard as a child that the reason Hollywood scores in
general and strings in particular can sound so distinctly Hollywood is because
of the secret that they produce an amalgamy of the real and the fake. Forging the
two into a stronger material than either of the two on their own could ever be.
Perhaps even then I had the thought, or at least an ungraspable sense, without
knowing the word, inexpressible but profoundly experienced. The hyperReal.

The Daft punk story is crazy.
Everything was recorded onto analog tape in rarified recording palaces like New
York's Electric Lady and LA's Capitol Studios. Human spontaneity was coveted;
computers, with their tendency toward mindless repetition, were not.

“Technology has made music accessible in a philosophically interesting way,
which is great,” says Bangalter, talking about the proliferation of home
recording and the laptop studio. “But on the other hand, when everybody has the
ability to make magic, it's like there's no more magic—if the audience can just
do it themselves, why are they going to bother?”

Ryan Dombal's Daft Punk interview for Pitchfork that came out in May 2013 is
riddled with descriptions of the interviewees affluence. We are told a story of
success through appearances. I imagine the article had the opposite of the
intended effect on me. I love the idea of democratising the means of
production.

"Round Robins are a method of recording a number of performances of the same
sample so that when playing repeated notes in fast succession you don't get
“machine gunning” a rapid repeat of the same sample that gives the game away
immediately."

This quote taken from a SpitFire Audio manual for a percussion sample library.
If you decide to keep this then you should find it.

Richard Feynman quote [where?]:

> Statements of science are not of what is true and what is not true, but
> statements of what is known with different degrees of certainty.

All that can be heard is real. Only imaginings of sounds are unreal. Sonorities
yet to heard. There are fictions. Narratives exist. We live alongside our lores.
There are stories that we tell each other, and that we tell ourselves. Admitting
the impossibility in knowing even one self. Certainly not each other. Definitely
not culture. We are all choosing to live with these stories even as as we make
increasingly feeble attempts at that loftiest of goals of understanding,
all the more likely settling for ways to cope as we are strung along by each other.

I trace the story of the impossibility of viewing all of the stones held
within Ryōanji from any vantage point to John Cage.

Complexity must not be a goal in itself.   
Strive to increase utility of information. 

In the notion of the real talk about IRL and conversely AFK and the promise of
The Public Internet and how the commercial internet is not that Stallman dream.

Use the example of how Drumpf shows that him having a thought is proof of
whatever he wishes. Something along the lines of "I have thought that I am good
at business so the statement _I am good at business_ is true.

What is philosophy?
It's when you think about something so much that you actually end up understanding it less.
- Corey Mohler

The task at hand is mainly organising sound. My ambition is to present a number
of materials, both in thought and in music. In doing so I hope to "tune" the
listener's perception of the musical works held within the project through the
means of text in order to allow for the possibility of greater immersion. 

Music appreciation is subjective. Who'd a thunk it?

Staying on brand.

I need to tell the story of the Japanese poetry group around year 1000 who
allowed each other to take new names every decade or so to start each decade
with a fresh voice. To become the resplendent new. The untainted eye. A new
voice through which to speak about new perspectives. As many times over as they
wished for as long as they lived and wrote. That story is maybe where I'd like
to go. To get to a point where I feel free to reinvent myself as an artist.   

In MPC: (Origin stories, lore, compare the brush, hyperReal tape recorder, high & low
culture. Maybe even status.)

Mark Fisher - Capitalist realism quotes:
the suspicion that the end has
already come, the thought that it could well be the case that the
future harbors only reiteration and re-permutation. Could it be
that there are no breaks, no 'shocks of the new' to come? Such
anxieties tend to result in a bi-polar oscillation: the 'weak
messianic' hope that there must be something new on the way
lapses into the morose conviction that nothing new can ever
happen. The focus shifts from the Next Big Thing to the last big
thing - how long ago did it happen and just how big was it? 

postmodernism remains a hugely
contested term, its meanings, appropriately but unhelpfully,
unsettled and multiple. 

For most people under
twenty in Europe and North America, the lack of alternatives to
capitalism is no longer even an issue. Capitalism seamlessly
occupies the horizons of the thinkable. Jameson used to report in
horror about the ways that capitalism had seeped into the very
unconscious; now, the fact that capitalism has colonized the
dreaming life of the population is so taken for granted that it is 
no longer worthy of comment. 

So long as we believe (in our hearts)
that capitalism is bad, we are free to continue to participate in
capitalist exchange. 

The protest impulse of the 60s posited a malevolent
Father, the harbinger of a reality principle that (supposedly)
cruelly and arbitrarily denies the 'right' to total enjoyment. This
Father has unlimited access to resources, but he selfishly - and
senselessly - hoards them. Yet it is not capitalism but protest itself
which depends upon this figuration of the Father; and one of the
successes of the current global elite has been their avoidance of
identification with the figure of the hoarding Father, even though
the 'reality' they impose on the young is substantially harsher than
the conditions they protested against in the 60s. 

The significance of
Green critiques is that they suggest that, far from being the only
viable political-economic system, capitalism is in fact primed to
destroy the entire human environment. The relationship between
capitalism and eco-disaster is neither coincidental nor accidental:
capital's 'need of a constantly expanding market', its 'growth 
fetish', mean that capitalism is by its very nature opposed to any
notion of sustainability.
