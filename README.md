### Mapping the valleys of the uncanny

Please note that I have switched over to editing [map_all.md.html](https://github.com/danielmkarlsson/mapping-the-valleys-of-the-uncanny/blob/master/map_all.md.html)  
Github does not render markDeep.  
Download the file to your machine and open it in a browser to see the markDeep formatting.  
Check out a sweet markDeep demo [here](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/features.md.html)
