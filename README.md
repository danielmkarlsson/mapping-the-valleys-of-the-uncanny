### Mapping the valleys of the uncanny

Please note that I have switched over to editing [map.md.html](https://github.com/danielmkarlsson/mapping-the-valleys-of-the-uncanny/blob/master/map.md.html)

Github does not render markDeep.  

Download the file to your machine and open it in a browser to see the markDeep formatting.  

Check out a sweet markDeep demo [here](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/features.md.html) to get a feel for why I think this is worth our time.

If you can't download files, for some reason, then you can sneek a peak [here](http://danielmkarlsson.com/map.md.html) but don't tell anyone, because it's not ready yet.
