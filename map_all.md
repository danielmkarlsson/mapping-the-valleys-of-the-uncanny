# Introduction

[ An investigation into process and method within the field of algorithmic
composition. ]

[ The role of instrumentation and timbre as they unwittingly conspire to designate
access, power, work and ultimately class. ] 

( I might have to walk this second description back to some extent, depending on
the brakes )

I've been a composer for a minute now and I've engaged with music in a lot of
different ways through the course of getting to where I'm at now in this moment
that has me writing this text. There have been different frameworks at different
times and those different frameworks have all come bundled with their own set of
different limitations. It's difficult to take apart but I think that, at least
sometimes those limitations inspired me. They  definitely affected the way my
music sounded. One way that I like to think about these frameworks is the word
project. Learning to play the guitar was a project. Learning to record myself
playing guitar was another. Playing in a band came next. Learning to make songs
together with friends sprung to life out of that. Fast forward through all of
the links in the chain that has been my life to the overarching project of
organising sound and this particular example of that. 

# Mapping The Valleys of The Uncanny 

The project is a collection of musical materials that
explore the idea of the uncanny valley as it relates to music being real, fake
or some strange combination of the two. This project is primarily one in which I
produce sound files. In a secondary capacity I am also producing a text file.

In my thesis I aim to present my thoughts on how my work writing code and making
music might be connected in some hopefully interesting ways to tensions within
my field ("field" used here in a broader sense). My own origin story is likely
another source for clues as to why I am driven to do the things that I do, but
also, why I am broken in the particular way that I am. I'd also like to explore
the possibility of making my thesis valuable to others in terms of it's utility
by including my code. Other ways I'd like to touch upon how value gets created
in a potential listener and or reader is narrative and place. I'll investigate
where my own ideas about organising sound come from by telling stories and
attempting to trace them back to their sources, engaging with them as lore,
particular to myself and, contrastingly, to the wider field of new music. 

I aim to maintain course towards a narrow field of research by limiting the
scope of my inquiry to mostly my own music and thoughts, tacking on to a lesser
degree my best guesses as to the origins of both.

# Uncanniness

What does it mean to other people?  
adjective having or seeming to have a supernatural or inexplicable basis; beyond
the ordinary or normal; extraordinary: uncanny accuracy; an uncanny knack of
foreseeing trouble.  mysterious; arousing superstitious fear or dread;
uncomfortably strange: Uncanny sounds filled the house.

Why am I drawn to it?  
It strikes me as contemporary and unexplored.

The role of instrumentation is on the one hand entirely arbitrary to me as I am
certain that the universe is fundamentally indifferent to my existence, and so,
subsequently to which sounds I sequence in what way. None the less
instrumentation is a source of immense fascination for me. Any sound could be
sequenced. Which sounds would I like to sequence? What are my preferences? I
know that I have at times let availability and prevalence to some extent dictate
my choices. I should like to address that with a number of works that make good
on promises of infinite abundance. After all anything is possible in Electronic
Music. Any sound at any time. Timbre of course fascinates composers. 

In my life I have come to regard certain sounds as desirable but illusive. The
price I've had to pay has sometimes been higher than I would have liked in order
to hear them for even the briefest of moments. I've had to work quickly and
compromise. I've felt that the prescribed modus operandi has been error prone
and difficult to utilize towards my ends of organising sound in the ways that I
prefer.

Within so called "New Music" there exists a great divide between the electronic
and the acoustic. Certain sounds are not easily reached for someone like me for
one reason or another.

As my work of organizing sound has led me further and further down the path of
algorithmic composition I have grown more and more interested in the role of
contexts and connotations that certain sounds bring about in an audience. I
never really had any deeper context for LinnDrum claps or Gabber kicks of my own
apart from the obvious fact that they are strictly out of bounds for anyone
looking to make serious music. While that forbidden quality still holds some
titillation I am now much more interested in my own coming into resonance. The
sounds I feel most strongly connected to coming up through New Music where
always out of reach. 

So in very practical terms: I've changed up my way of working. I've gone from
making recordings of musicians playing my scores to now creating sample packs.
Things like the organ have been great because I've been able to do that on my
own. Last year I did a piece for ensemble and through that I met some great
musicians who have been very helpful. Frida Mossop is a great violinist who has
great tone and understands what I want. Also Pau Villa is a percussionist that
I've worked with to create a lot of material. There are some other people also
that I've worked with to create some great packs that I am now sequencing. Given
that I am sequencing files in a computer instead of writing scores for humans to
either misunderstand or not care about, new things are possible. I am happy and
the work is progressing. Up to now I've made études for single instruments. The
focus going forward is to work up from duo to trio and so on up to larger
ensembles.

Most of the time I feel like I'm a high functioning automaton at best and that
all of my veracious peaks of inspiration are just bright ideas channeled to me
through popular cultural imperialism. That for all of my talk of the need for
newness and weirdness in music I'm just regurgitating things I've heard. Things
I've been taught to think, do and to make into sound. So I struggle. With
tremendous doubt. I'm trying to find something new to say even though I know
everything has been said a thousand times. I guess I'd be lucky if I can end up
with a subtle difference in emphasis or tone. The information conveyed it self;
Now that would be something.  But that is so much further down the rabbit hole.

So certain things are different when sequencing sounds in a computer. Sounds can
be played faster. That's interesting because we have that faster playing in
music played by humans also. It's exciting because a lot of the time it gets
held up as virtuosic. We use phrases like gifted or talented musicians.  A
computer can play _exactly_ the same amplitude and timbre multiple times in a
row. Humans can't, well actually the constraint is higher up than that. Simple
physics, Newtonian forces won't allow it. We've never held that kind of
virtuosity up as equilibristic instrumentalist practise. I don't think we'd
react quite the same way if a human got even remotely close. "You sound like a
machine" they'd say. It would be derogatory. They might not even know what
machine they'd be referring to. It would be the sampler and more specifically
an early days sampler with a single layer of samples. No round-robin switching
out of the samples to mimic what happens "naturally" when a key is struck on a
Celesta. An infinite amount of the subtlest variation explodes out of that
action each time.


# The Real and the fake

(Big section proly. What is real? Ideally prove that all that can be heard is
real. Only imaginings are unreal) Fictions. Narratives. Lores. Stories we tell
ourselves. Admitting the impossibility in knowing one self and still choosing
to live with these stories as an attempt at that goal of understanding. I need
to tell the story of the Japanese poetry group around year 1000 who allowed
each other to take new names every decade or so to start each decade with a
fresh voice. To become the resplendent new. The untainted eye. As many times
over as they wished for as long as they lived and wrote. That story is maybe
where I'd like  to go. To get to a point where I feel free to reinvent myself as
an artist. Get that sweet Zizek action in here.

That which resists symbolization 
“The real is what resists symbolization absolutely.” ― Jacques Lacan, The
Seminar of Jacques Lacan: Freud's Papers on Technique
Define hyperReal. 
(link to Wikipedia)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreality]
Even better than the real thing. Heightened states of being,
as in the impossibility of hearing a multitude of things sounding in a multitude
spaces, at a multitude of different times all at once. Transcending limitations
of time and space through non realTime assemblage. There is a line between The
Real and the fake. This position is defended at any cost. The Real can not,
_must_ not, allow itself to be devalued. A great many people have invested
heavily in doing difficult things. Shortcuts are frowned upon.
Authenticity of what exactly?
Value to be traded in for what?
Tradition to be upheld for what purpose?
Cutting corners implies future weakness of structural integrity.
And so it goes. Positions of power are upheld. Barriers to entry kept in place.
Nothing we can do.

"...half-awake, unable to distinguish the virtual from the real"

"Round Robins are a method of recording a number of performances of the same
sample so that when playing repeated notes in fast succession you don't get
“machine gunning” a rapid repeat of the same sample that gives the game away
immediately."

and longing for the days when real musicians used computers.

# The MPC

(Origin stories, lore, compare the brush, hyperReal tape recorder, hi & lo
culture.)  If the tape recorder was hyperReal then the MPC is hyperHyperReal
(compare postPostModern) and controlling Kontakt with SuperCollider is
infinitely hyperRealised in comparison to the original origin story.  When the
story of our origin (specifically New Music's origin) is told through the
perspective Then the tape recorder grows to the size of the studio with
undeniable monumental prestige. If we adjust the point of departure to adjust
the scope of our story to use the MPC as the starting point an alternative
telling of history emerges.  The story we now construct has ramifications for
where density is found. Closer to our time. Preferably in the now. Year zero is
no longer 1930 with that of the Americans liberating the tape recorder from the
rubble of nazi Germany. Instead the year is 1988.  Public Enemy burst into a
popular culture running at break-neck-speed  with their debut release It Takes a
Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back. Our origin story is no longer one of  first
meanderings of applying an alien technology inside of a void. Instead the very
modus operandi is referentiality. The sampler and sampling not the tape recorder
and tape recordings. Very the history of Electronische Musik begins with the
tape recorder and then explodes outward into the physical monument of the studio
our new origin story is one of implosion. Both stories originate from a single
machine.  Samplers inside of computers are direct descendants of the MPC. They
now have no physical form. They are software. They computer disappears into
generalization.  A computer can perform the task of any specialized machine like
the tape recorder or the sampler. A general purpose computer. Incorporeal.
Purpose defined in software.

I want to write about the MPC. It wasn't until much later that I realised that
the magical machine that I had heard about was the MPC. I first heard the story
when I was a kid listening to NWA, Public Enemy, De La Soul. Then finally when I was 
older from a guy who showed me J-Dilla's Donuts. He told me the story as we were 
listening to the album together. It was interleaved. The story was. It got 
interrupted by "oh oh and check this part out". Little things about the production. 
Details. They say the devil is in the details. Anyway I really got that story handed 
to me. The last celebrated experimental hip hop record. Didn't have any rapping on it.
The story goes he made it in the hospital as he was dying of a terminal illness.
Had his MPC on his belly in the hospital bed. I don't know if that's true. I
guess I've put off trying to find out if it's true because I like the story.
"A kiss may not be the truth but it's what we wish were true." That bit is from
Steve Martin's LA Story. In the movie I think we're meant to think it's a
Shakespeare quote. That's a another one I've thought a thousand times about and
never got to the bottom of.

# Pine cones are magical

(I'd like to change your mind about everything you know in your heart of hearts
to be true) Up is down. Bad is good.  While I don't believe in actual magic I
find this passage from Jarod Anderson's The CryptoNaturalist useful for purposes
of illustration:

"Pine cones are beautiful, geometric wonders that are only devalued by their
abundance. Fractal sculptures. Evergreen snowflakes. Blossoms in wood.
(Familiarity can rust magic. A little mental effort returns the shine.)" 

_ The CryptoNaturalist @CryptoNature 2018-08-24

[link to tweet](https://twitter.com/CryptoNature/status/1032808690292797440)

I would like to return the shine, as it were, to the task of organising sound in
general and to working with algorithmic composition in particular. 
Stretch goals would be to influence people to join me in rewiring the term
Computer Music to hold a new meaning. One tailored specifically to fit our time.
As computers are no longer held in artificial scarcity but rather available in
abundance new ways of thinking and acting in the world are possible.

Oram's new Atlantis:
“We have also sound-houses, where we practise and demonstrate all sounds, and
their generation. We have harmonies which you have not, of quarter-sounds, and
lesser slides of sounds. Divers instruments of music likewise to you unknown,
some sweeter than any you have, together with bells and rings that are dainty
and sweet. We represent small sounds as great and deep; likewise great sounds
extenuate and sharp; we make divers tremblings and warblings of sounds, which in
their original are entire. We represent and imitate all articulate sounds and
letters, and the voices and notes of beasts and birds. We have certain helps
which set to the ear do further the hearing greatly. We have also divers strange
and artificial echoes, reflecting the voice many times, and as it were tossing
it: and some that give back the voice louder than it came, some shriller, and
some deeper; yea, some rendering the voice differing in the letters or
articulate sound from that they receive. We have also means to convey sounds in
trunks and pipes, in strange lines and distances.”

_ “The New Atlantis” – Francis Bacon, 1623

That's some story. Actually, for me it's a story wrapped in another story.
Daphne Oram put that quote on the wall at The BBC Radiophonic Workshop and
_that's_ the story I've been told.
 
Do you remember the story of Daft punk? 
Everything was recorded onto analog tape in rarified recording palaces like New
York's Electric Lady and LA's Capitol Studios. Human spontaneity was coveted;
computers, with their tendency toward mindless repetition, were not.

“Technology has made music accessible in a philosophically interesting way,
which is great,” says Bangalter, talking about the proliferation of home
recording and the laptop studio. “But on the other hand, when everybody has the
ability to make magic, it's like there's no more magic—if the audience can just
do it themselves, why are they going to bother?”  

[link](https://pitchfork.com/features/cover-story/reader/daft-punk/)

Ryan Dombal's Daft Punk interview for Pitchfork that came out in May 2013 is
riddled with descriptions of the interviewees affluence. We are told a story of
success through appearances. I imagine the article had the opposite of the
intended effect on me. I love the idea of democratising the means of
production.

Take your fingers right up to your ears. As close as you can get them without
touching your ears. Now rub your fingers together ever so gently. You can hear
that can't you. Now imagine trying to hear such a faint sound across from a
concert hall or even just a stage. You would not be able to. Now image an
orchestra. Something close to a hundred people. They wouldn't be able to fit
there with all of their instruments in that close proximity where you heard that
faint sound of your fingers rubbing together just now. Right there is where I
put the microphone. Each time, as close as I can get it. For each instrument and
sometimes even changing the placement to optimize fully for a particular
articulation.

# Rooms

(Ties into place. The absurdity and poetic nature of imagining believing that a
photograph can steal a soul) I've come to understand that my fascination for
room tones is connected to my confusion about my class identity. Mimer first. I
didn't realize it at the time.  And then later, The Machine Hall in Ställberg.
It was right under my nose then but it took me quite a while to piece the puzzle
together. It's impossible for the narrative component of which space I use to
travel to the distance to the listener on it's own. For me it's different. I
know the name of the convolution file. I can imagine the workers there. Through
a wrinkle in time. Working, ceaselessly, dutifully. And now that the lightning
has been caught in the bottle I can imagine that work filling that room with
sound. From the lowest rumbles through the spectrum all the way up the ladder to
the harshest height of the audible spectrum. At the end of it we subtract time
and we've captured if not the room itself then it's essence, or if you care to
indulge me, it's soul. My fascination has been focusing in on trying to pin down
the work that happened there. It can't be saved for later and understood given
enough time. My origin story will always elude me. If these walls could talk we
say. My thoughts connect things up and make patterns. Compare another cavernous
room tone; The church. A place of worship. A place to wonder in awe of god's
greatness. The organ was the first big organised sound. That room is part of how
we've heard that instrument. The resonance. Place and narrative intersect in the
tone of the room. As the room resonates we are brought into resonance with
ideas. I never believed in god. I never believed that narrative. I know work was
real. The workers were real. Their struggle was real. I believe in that
narrative.


# State

The code is static. Why is that important?  The frozen state yielding a
multitude of infinities in variation through time fascinates me. Feels
paradoxical. Goes on to talk about complexity. The scope or sampling window
matters.  Static or in flux. The fan in the Robert Miles on AI safety video is
the initial instance that made me think of this.  Has to do with the
presentation aspect. I work on the code until it reaches a static state which is
most to my liking. While I might not listen to an eternity's worth of the
generated material I'll listen to a good long while. The longest I have in the
past listened to a material to make sure I liked all of the material I generated
with a static piece of code is 8 and a half hours. I did that for No value
without utility which can be found here:

By projecting static code in combination with fixed media is for the greater
part due to my fascination for complexity emerging out of simplicity. To a
smaller degree I cant help but go against the prescribed modus operandi of
playing the code within so called live coding like an instrument. That is not
what I want to do. I want to organise sound in a very specific way. Another nice
aspect of static code is that it greatly increases portability. I think I'd be a
lot more interested in distributing something that was not video. Who knows what
the future will hold.

Might be fun also to touch briefly on the idea of state as memory as in
functional programming in general and Haskell in particular. At least the
personal encounters part. That whole engage with it as lore thing again.

"The only state is time"  
How to talk about this without giving power to it's source?
 
"It's all dead simple, I have no real interest in technical complexity, and this
music has a streamlined quality I admire. No gesture is strained or wasted and
the music is complex, the technology is simple, a better way round than the age
old problem of academic electronic music where muscular technology too often
produces pissweak sounds."

# The Believing Game

The task at hand is mainly organising sound. My ambition is to present a number
of materials, both in thought and in music. In doing so I hope to "tune" the
listener's perception of the musical works held within the project through the
means of text in order to allow for the possibility of greater immersion. 

When I was a kid I would sometimes stare for long stretches of time at high
ceilings imagining what it would be like to be in that upside down world in the
ceiling. To walk around up there, looking up at the world down here. For
everything to be so different, about the way we perceive this place, where we
are now. You are reluctant to have your perspective changed. Your world views
are pretty much set. Let's play a game you and I. It's called: The Believing
Game.  

I most likely will have to reference

# Conclusion: The Impossibility of The Maps

( Nothing is real, everything is permitted, preferences of style exist,
aesthetics do not )

The subjective nature of experiencing in general and especially in music because
everyone is an expert because they've loved music their whole lives. Everybody
love's music right?

If you are doing creative work then to some extent, sure, I think it could be a
good idea to try to write down some of your thoughts about the task at hand from
your perspective.

What is the utmost of subtlety?

How about narrative and place as two examples of two extra musical paths to engagement.

Artificiality can be devastating. 
Place: Make the case that a piece of code can be thought of as sculpture or as a
place. What are some examples of good places? The stone garden is a nice story.
The shopping mall is another place. Not as nice a place.  How about narrative or
place? Extra musical paths to engagement Artificiality can be devastating.
