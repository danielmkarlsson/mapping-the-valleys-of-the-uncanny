**An investigation ensues**

Let's start simple. I like simple. In this text I'm going to be citing other
texts. I'm citing other texts partly because I think that it is a thing that
people do when they write master theses. The other part of why I'm citing other
texts is because it reminds me of sampling. I'm interested in sampling. We'll
get to why I think sampling and subsequently citing other texts in this thesis
is interesting but for now it's important to me that you know why I cite. I do
it because in my mind, I'm actually playing back a sample. It's a sample
containing text instead of sound. You are now ready to receive my first
citation.

Steve Martin wrote the script for _LA Story_ and in that film he also plays the
main character Harris K. Telemacher who addresses his unrequited love this way: 

> All I'm saying is that, when I'm around you, I find myself showing off, which
> is the idiot's version of being interesting.[^Martin]

When I am citing other texts I'm not doing it to try to impress you. I'm not
saying that I think anyone else's way of doing this is bad or anything. All I'm
saying is that, when I'm writing this, I find myself performing and, in that
performing, relating to ideas I have about other people's expectations. Long
story short; I guess you could say I have issues. These issues are mine. It's
not you, it's me.

Greg Egan writes in _Diaspora_:

> Every orphan was an explorer, sent to map uncharted territory. And every orphan
> was the uncharted territory itself.[^Egan]

You knew this already, but all of the quotes that I use can be traced back to
their origins. There you would find the complete body of work of their creator.
We're establishing a baseline here remember? I included the above quote because
it's from my favourite book. The reason it is my favourite book is because it is
a complete recounting of all of our yet unlived communal future, as a utopia. I
like to think that this says something about me and also about my sensibilities.
We could keep playing it this way. My liking something could be a basis for
inclusion. You might be able to piece together something towards an
understanding of my influences this way.

Karl Marx writes in _Theses on Feuerbach_: 

> The philosophers have only _interpreted_ the world in various ways; the point,
> however, is to _change_ it.[^Marx]

The above quote tells you for sure that I am at least a socialist, if you hadn't
picked up on that vibe prior to this explicit evidence. It also says something
about how I'm fond of the idea that any pattern can be broken. Anything and
everything is subject to change. The "world" here is dependent on the scope we
apply to it. You can have your pick here whether or not it is literal as in the
planet's impending demise due to capitalism-induced climate disaster and
subsequent resource wars, _or_ given the terrifying nature of that particular
avenue of thought, you might prefer one of the smaller scopes, e.g. The
Enlightenment, Academia, Artistic Research within new music, etc. 

**Public Service Announcement**

I should state that I'm not attempting to put forth rigorous proof of anything.
An example of an open problem requiring rigorous proof would be something like
"Can there be a logical solution to the creation of benevolent General
Artificial Intelligence under provably safe conditions?" That would be a
Computer Science paper. That would probably happen on a Doctoral level (or above
even?). This is not that. This text, although not directly engaged in the
production of scientific knowledge, does however aim to be of use. More on
utility later. This is artistic research, and as such, a single collapsing of a
wavefront within a form of expression which is not yet fully formed, and still
coming into being. There is quite a bit of wiggle room here and I intend to make
ample use of it because, as we'll come back to, freedoms and liberties interest
me. 

I've been a composer for a while now. I've been involved with music in a lot of
different ways through the course of getting to where I'm at now, in this
moment, that has me writing this text. There have been different frameworks at
different times, and those different frameworks have all come bundled with their
own distinct set of different limitations. This kind of thing is always
difficult to take apart but I think that, at least sometimes, those limitations
have inspired me. They definitely effected the way my music sounded, that much I
can tell you is for sure. 

One way that I like to think about these frameworks is with the word _project_.
Learning to play the guitar was a project. Learning to record myself playing the
guitar was another. Playing in a band came next. Learning to structure sound
together with friends sprung to life out of that. If we fast forward through all
of the links in the chain we arrive at the overarching project of organising
sound, and then, this particular example of that.

One fundamental difference between acoustic and electronic music is that
electronic music can be ungoverned by Newtonian forces. I think that is entirely
amazing. Any sound can arrive at any time. There need not be a sounding body or
physical object present in front of you. I hear someone in the back yelling
about speakers. Sure, sure, sure but we don't have to get stuck there.
Acousmatic music was a thing. I acknowledge that. No need to substitute one
fetichising of the corporeal with another as we go forward. The speaker is a
conduit, or put another way; a funnel. Thinking about it as a filter can be fun
but messy. What interests me the most is the stuff going through the funnel, and
how to make it. 

**We are free**

Let's move on to what we are afforded from following the line of thinking that
we are free from the shackles of the finite, and of the physical world. Sound now
enjoys morphological freedom through a myriad of transformations. It is
malleable to the utmost degree. We have at our disposal an astounding plethora
of tools through which to manipulate and organise sound. 

This thesis project is a collection of musical materials that explore the idea
of the uncanny valley as it relates to music being real, fake or some strange
combination of the two. This thesis project is primarily one in which I produce
sound files. In a secondary capacity I'm also producing a text file.

In this text I aim to present some of my thoughts on how my work writing code
and making music might be connected, in some hopefully interesting ways, to my
field. I'm unlikely to be able to adequately convey my own origin myth.  Instead
I'll focus on stories I've been told about music, throughout my life, inside and
outside of academia. I have a strong suspicion that these stories have shaped my
coming into being as a composer. However difficult the task of introspection,
and ultimately to know one self proves to be, I at least regard these stories as
a source for clues as to why I am driven to do the things that I do. 

**Who is speaking?**

I don't think that there can be anything like "The Self" without others, and
that "The Self" is largely about imagining other's view of yourself.

Leslie Ervine PhD, University of Colorado, writes in her Qualitative Sociology
paper _Even Better Than The Real Thing_:

> One's stories persuade one's audience that one is a particular kind of person.
> When one is one's own audience, the telling amounts to having a self.[^Ervine]

What particular kind of person would I like to be? A Composer with a capital C!

> Good stories must meet several requirements. They must fulfil their audiences
> expectations for what counts as convincing. They must be coherent, drawing
> together disparate elements that end up seeming inherently related. They must
> make events seem to lead to one another. In addition, they must have satisfying
> endings - not happy endings, necessarily, but endings that provide resolution
> while leaving enough ambiguity to enliven listeners imaginations.[^Ervine]

This is how I think about this thesis project. I am doing just that drawing
together of disparate elements. Just like in a lot of music that is out there,
the sequence, or the order in which things are introduced, matters. A very
common trait of many musics that have been made, is that they exist as a linear
experience. They are a form of artistic expression which exists within the time
domain. Compare music to sculpture. While this perhaps is not an entirely water
tight example, I use it here because I use it all of the time, as anyone who
knows me can attest. I'm guessing that it's important that I use it here, in
order to maintain consistency. You get the idea.

> a U2 song, even better than the real thing. For listeners, stories make

> time-consuming, costly, or otherwise impossible.[^Ervine]

I define the criteria for a good story as the following: A story that I can
remember, and recount at a later time. Someone has told me a story and I either
like the story, or the person that told it to me, or both. I connect the story
to the person, in my mind, to varying degrees. Sometimes I end up convinced that
a particular person telling a particular story, at a particular time, says
something about what kind of person that person is, and other times not. I think
about all of the people that I have met, coming up through music, as one person;
Me. I was there every time someone told me a story. Those stories undoubtedly
came to shape the way I think about music and about organising sound.

How to tell a story well is subjective or at least a matter of taste. I think
about functionality as a guide for constructing the story of the self. How
functional is it to include a particular aspect in the story, with regards to
our intended outcome? The intended outcome here is to arrive at a story which is
accessible and comprehensible. We want to understand each other. We are looking
for clues so that we can make better guesses about future behaviour. We are
looking for patterns. We are fundamentally geared for it. It is literally
hardwired into our senses. Pattern recognition is at the core of what it means
to have consciousness. Seeing as music's existence is dependent on hearing and
reasoning about what we hear, I could say that musical form exploits this
pattern recognition aspect of consciousness to keep the listener engaged, and
that that might work with how you view the world, maybe.

goal.[^Ervine]

**Why should we listen?**

That common goal, as I see it, is organizing sound. This makes us the same you
and I. Mostly everyone we know shares this common goal. I trace this way of
thinking about our common goal back to Edgard Varese talking about his own music
as organised sound. I am fine with that description. It is a very broad and
inclusive way of thinking about what we are doing, all of us together as a
group. 

I want to keep finding new answers to the question of how to organise sound in
ways that continue to interest me. Part of my staying interested is engaging
with other people who are also engaged in this same struggle. I want to be part
of a Community.

I've thought a lot about how to set myself up so that I become increasingly
unlikely to get bored. Cutting myself off from people increases the risk of
getting bored. Sharing my tools increases the likeliness of contact and or
stimulating communication with other people.

In this text I don't just want to talk _at_ people about my internal state. I
genuinely want to try to make an honest attempt to make my thesis valuable to
others in terms of it's utility. This is why I've chosen to include the code I
used to make the music, as part of this text. My thinking here is that there
exists a certain kind of reader that won't want to sit through these touchy
feely meanderings unless there is a promise of some code that can be run at the
end of the day. For that reader: Here is that promise now.
 
I couldn't resist tying back sharing the code into this thesis project's
narrative framework, as maps. You would be free to connect my code to anything
you want and control it. You could make your own connections to the things you
care about. Edit my code, to find your own path through the valley. 

**What's wrong?**

Analogies are a special category of story. They are frail things. I don't
particularly care for them as I find that they too easily fall prey to being
contradicted by themselves as all of the things[^things] are fundamentally
different from each other. For example it doesn't work to say that gravity is
kind of like a rubber band pulling you back to the earth when you jump up. This
falls apart because the rubber band is also subjected to gravity within that
analogy. When analogy is used to describe domains that we kind of "know" are at
least a little fuzzy, and or subjective, like emotions and ways of thinking
poetically about the world, then I think that can be understood as something akin
to a shorthand, and receives a passing grade. Now, with all that in mind, here
comes an analogy: Certain sonorities always made me feel like I was on the
outside of a locked door. Which sonorities I am referring to here is largely
exemplified in the music I made for this thesis project. You really should start
listening to the music if you haven't already.

MIT guide to Lock Picking: 

> ...it is worth pointing out that lock picking is just one way to bypass a lock,
> though it does cause less damage than brute force techniques. In fact, it may
> be easier to bypass the bolt mechanism than to bypass the lock. It may also be
> easier to bypass some other part of the door or even avoid the door entirely.
> Remember: There is always another way, usually a better one.[^MIT]

Having picked the lock, or otherwise bypassed it (perhaps metaphysically walking
through walls!), I find myself inside of this most coveted room. Inside the room
are an abundance of instruments I'd never be able to gain access to. The best
part of all is that they can all be computer controlled. It is an amazing room,
and I am very happy that I can enter into it whenever I want, and spend as much
time there as I like. No one ever comes into the room to say:

"Who the hell are you? You can't be in here touching these ~~instruments~~
priceless museum pieces! _Security!!_"

I'm in a safe space now, and that feels good. The thing that feels even better
is that I got in, by thinking about how I could gain access using the tools
available to me. Boom! I fixed my problem. I don't have a problem anymore. I
should be happy now right? Nope!. That's not how this works. I find struggle
wherever I go. I keep going. Trying new things.

Here is an example of the frailty I was talking about earlier. You wouldn't be
particularly well served by bringing the wrong map with you on a hiking trip in
the woods. That wouldn't be poetic, you would just regret it. I much prefer
diagrams to analogies. So much more serious seeming and they have that sweet,
sweet science feel to them.

**The Cyber is huge**

Trying to make sense of what music making is, and also, what subsequent publishing as
"cybernetic practice" even means, all seems very difficult, so let's use a tool to help
us do that thinking.

Stephen Willats is a British artist who has self-published _Control magazine_,
a seminal forum for artists¬¥ writings on art practice and social organization
since 1965. I'm going to let Willats walks us through the diagram and I'll
add some thoughts in between:

> This diagram shows the position an art work traditionally occupies between the
> artist and his audience. Two fundamental discrete loops are shown, which are 
> isolated from each other by the art work. There is no form of interaction 
> between the two which could generate mutual understanding as would be the case 
> in a successful conversation. In the absence of such a procedure both the 
> audience and artist become locked in their own perceptual biases.[^Willats]

The audience views the result of the artist's process of composing the work and
then goes on about their lives. Both artists and the audience proceed to make
and experience new artworks respectively. The arrows keep on going up forever,
like on a conveyor belt infinitely churning out new artworks, and experiences of
those artworks. Some particular work, by some particular artist, may resonate
more with some individual human being held within the mass that is the audience.
The prescribed modus operandi for this individual is then to take an interest in
the artist, or rather, the story that has been constructed about the artist. To
be neatly consumed, perhaps in the form of a biography or an interview. I don't
think this model serves us very well. At least not on it's own.

> I wanted to look at all means of communication within society to take what I
> could from everywhere I could, and reformulate it into a new way of
> operating.[^Willats]

This makes me think of sampling as an act which holds potential to be radically
instrumental both in reevaluating not just intellectual property laws, but the
very concept of property itself. 

> I wanted to intervene in the fabric of society directly. Not just sit inside a
> box, but to move freely within the interpersonal infrastructure of society. To
> create the means of people transforming their own sense of reality and identity
> and vision of the future.[^Willats]

If we were to share our code, the audience would be more likely to be empowered
to _do_ something, instead of just continue to go about their lives as
consumers. Consumers of musics and of stories about artists. Perhaps idolizing
them. Putting the artist, and subconsciously the idea that they themselves as
part of an audience (which is wholly separate from the artist), could create
something, anything.

> The outcome that I was interested in was the idea of self-organization.
> Transformation in the self, or creative potential of the self, so that anybody
> could create their own being in relation to other people. I was interested in
> society. I see that there's a richness in relationships between people,
> community.[^Willats]

I think self-organization as Willats uses it above is problematic because it
could be misconstrued as the invisible hand of the market which ideologues
proclaim needs to be left alone, forever, in order to "self-organize" supply and
demand of goods and services. It's a good thing that there is a license that
explicitly negates that. It's GPLv3. The specific transformation in the self
that I'm aiming at changing is attitudes towards constructed narratives designed
to create cult followings. They are not helping to deepen the audience's
relationship with the artwork. Giving the audience access to the GPLv3 licensed
code on The Public Internet might not do that all of the time but it is a thing
to try instead of going along with a prescribed method mindlessly. 

> ... there was an interconnection between the audience, the language, the meaning,
> the intention, and the context and presentation. This meant that the strategies

> interconnections between these things.[^Willats]

I've had a bunch of experiences prior to working on this thesis project. I have
made and heard a whole lot of music. Not only that but basically everything that
has ever happened to me and the things that I have come to believe, about myself
and about the world, I take with me into this new project. That happens with
every project. The framework surrounding this particular project really make me
acutely aware of that. Same thing goes for a listener actually. They also bring
everything with them into the act of listening. They might not know it but
that's how it is. Nothing happens in a vacuum. The two discrete loops of the
artist and audience are still kept separate in other, necessary ways. I need to
create music to keep myself balanced, but that doesn't mean that I surrender my
privacy. The listener shouldn't have to either. Privacy is a growing concern.
Especially on the internet.

Isis Agora Luvcruft, who at the time was a Core Developer of The Tor Project,
relates in ver[^Urticator] talk _Network Security - Anonymous Networks &
Communications_ at Raboud University:

> Privacy is necessary for all other rights. Even if you don't care about your own
> right to privacy it's incredibly antisocial to claim that the right to privacy

The Public Internet and the commercial internet are two very different places.
I thought for sure that once we got decent speeds going for most folks (yes, in
the global west, I know) we'd see some great stuff happening for distribution.
Self publishing web sites and genuine communication between all kinds of folks
leading to all kinds of profound new insights in all kinds of domains. Instead
we got social media and all kinds of really terrible things happening. Just
awful.

That is what the commercial internet looks like to me. I am so immensely
fatigued by it's "sad passions". The endless stream of strangers with perfectly
fake smiles has me wanting to never see another stranger's face ever again.
They're all so desperate to sell me everything I don't want. They probably
weren't even told what their faces were being used to sell. So unreal.

Max Read writes in _How much of the internet Is fake?_:

> ... through layers of diminishing reality.  
> ... half-awake, unable to distinguish the virtual from the real[^Read]

The infrastructure we use for getting things done on The Public Internet is
something we need to look both forwards but also backwards in order to make
sense of. Social media platforms or any other part of the commercial internet is
not a part of that. If we were to build our own Public Internet though, now that
would really be something different all together! 

Brass tax nomenclature for increasing our freedoms relating to publishing our
work:

‚Ä¢ Self published web sites <br>
‚Ä¢ RSS <br>
‚Ä¢ Email (lists) <br>
‚Ä¢ P2P <br>

These three apply to everyone. The last one below is most important to music
makers in general, and myself in particular because I didn't have access to this
technology prior to this thesis project:

‚Ä¢ A decent media player <br>

When I say decent, I mean that the audio quality needs to be decent (as in
320kbs constant bit rate for audio and video). I also mean that artists should
be in control of their own works and not supplying a platform with free
"content", to attract listeners which then get bombarded with atrocious ads. My
wording here approaches questions of ethics and morality. You get the idea:
Platforms bad, self publishing good.

One last thing while we're adjacent to the topic of the internet in general. In
the Piratebay trial, Peter Sunde explained in his testimony:

<big>**02. On uncanniness**</big>

**The meanings of words**

Let's have a look in a dictionary[^Dictionary] just to get a broad sense of our
bearings here:

‚Ä¢ Having or seeming to have a supernatural or inexplicable basis. <br>  
‚Ä¢ Beyond the ordinary or normal. <br>  
‚Ä¢ Extraordinary. <br>

"Uncanny accuracy; An uncanny knack of foreseeing trouble."

‚Ä¢ Mysterious. <br> 
‚Ä¢ Arousing superstitious fear or dread. <br> 
‚Ä¢ Uncomfortably strange. <br> 

"Uncanny sounds filled the house."    

Let me make an attempt at explaining why I am drawn to it. First off it strikes
me as contemporary, seeing as we are all living through post-truth, and secondly
because I regard it as largely unexplored when thought of as a musical
parameter. It turns out originality, or otherness, is important to me.

Uncanniness looks unexplored enough as a space to peek my interest. From where
I'm standing uncanniness being largely unexplored checks out as true. This
_perspective_ is something that I have created via the act of viewing and
thinking about the world. In our time of post-truth, simply having a thought,
and then remembering that one has had that thought previously, can lead one to
thinking that it is a true statement, on par with statements like: Gravity
exists! At the time of writing politicians at the highest levels behave in this
exact way all of the time. It is eerie how "manifestation" is everywhere now.
Strange times indeed.

**An unexpected impact on choices**

All sample libraries end up existing on a spectrum ranging from authentic
sounding to blatantly fictitious. It interests me to think about where a
particular library lands on that spectrum for an imagined listener. After that
there are aspects of how a library is recorded and scripted that influence me to
make all kinds of choices regarding the construction of the music. Dynamics and
registration most especially, but in some cases even pitch material has revealed
itself to me through this lens.  

In researching this text it was particularly inspiring to read Roboticist
Masahiro Mori's thoughts in [_The Uncanny Valley_](https://www.tiny.cc/19bg5y),
and through that text finding [Bunraku](https://www.tiny.cc/mecg5y). It has
impacted my view of the world and about how reality is something we all hold
together by reenacting. We are constantly reminding each other of how to behave,
what to regard as real, and what to discard as unreal. Or as William Gibson put
it in _Neuromancer_: 

> A consensual hallucination.[^Gibson]
>

Gibson was talking about something a little different when he wrote that. That's
part of what interests me about sampling. We can both refer to, and at the same
time recontextualize anything that has previously been recorded, either as sound
or as text. When we quote text we are bringing the context of academia at least
and perhaps even of The Enlightenment with us. We are standing on the shoulders
of giants. Literally all of recorded history. A history that has been kept safe
for us so that we might learn from it. With sampling of audio it's a little
different. Intellectual property laws forbid it. You would have to obtain
permission from the rights holders in order to distribute a derivative work. You
would most likely have to relinquish all of your potential profit to the rights
holders. This "potentiality" however, is shrinking rapidly. How will artists
receiving fractions of pennies per stream impact their their likeliness to
sample? How will listeners having access to "all" of the music ever recorded
impact their likeliness to sample?

As my work of organizing sound has led me further and further down the path of
algorithmic composition, I have grown more and more interested in the role of
contexts and of connotations that certain sounds bring about in an audience
because of their potential to elicit a sense of the uncanny. 

I never really had any deeper context for LinnDrum Kicks or Four Operator FM
Synthesis. No contexts that I regarded as my own, except for the obvious context
that these sounds are strictly out of bounds for anyone looking to make
"serious" music. While that forbidden quality still holds some titillation I
have moved on to thinking that for the most part; No one cares. Don't worry
though. This is a good thing. Trust me. It means that we are free. Free to dream
endlessly and to make anything we want. Any structure or intricate web of
references. Absolutely free. Steve Martin wrote about this sense of freedom in
_LA Story_:

> No one is looking to the outside for verification that what they're doing
> is ok.[^Martin]

**Fundamental differences**

Getting back to the practical; Certain things are different when sequencing
sounds in a computer. Sounds can be played faster. That's interesting because we
have fast playing in music played by humans also. It's interesting because a lot
of the time it gets held up as virtuosic in different ways, within different
genres. We use phrases like gifted or talented musicians. A computer can play
_exactly_ the same amplitude and timbre multiple times in a row. Humans can't,
well actually the constraint is higher up than that. Simple physics really,
Newtonian forces won't allow it. We've never held that kind of virtuosity up as
equilibristic instrumentalist practice. I don't think we'd react quite the same
way if a human got even remotely close to that type of musical capacity. "You
sound like a machine" they'd say. It would be derogatory. They might not even
know what machine they'd be referring to. It would be the sampler and more
specifically an early days sampler like the Akai MPC60 or the E-mu SP-1200, with
a single layer of samples. No round-robin switching out of the samples to mimic
what happens "naturally" when a key is struck on a Steinway grand piano at
different velocities. An infinite amount of the subtlest variation explodes out
of that action each time. The cross talk inside the body of the instrument as
multiple keys are struck elevate the richness of timbral interplay to
immeasurable heights of exponentiality. The sampler is different, is all I'm
saying here. It has it's own behaviour. If we try hard, we can have a unique
relationship to this "new" instrument, that has nothing to do with that Steinway
grand piano. We would have to do the admittedly difficult work of adjusting our
way of thinking about the world in order to achieve this goal.

**The notion of The Real**

I find my own thinking aligning with these parts of Slavoj Zizek's in _The
Reality of the Virtual_. 

> ...when I deal with you, I'm basically not dealing with the real you. I'm
> dealing with the virtual image of you. And this image has reality, in the sense
> that it, none the less, structures the way I am dealing with you. And then
> this idealization is crucial.[^Zizek]

I substitute the interactions of two individual human beings with an audience's
experiencing of an artwork from two sides of it. More on these two sides of an
artwork later. I agree that idealization is crucial, and it is the case within
this thesis project as well. Had there not been this idealized view of acoustic
instruments active in the world, then there would be no foundation for me to
build my castles in the sky upon. I am trying to relate to my surroundings
somehow, by creating these works.

> This would be the first elementary level: Imaginary virtual, in the sense of
> the virtual image which determines how we interact with other people. Virtual
> image in the sense of: Although we interact with real people, we erase, we
> behave as if whole strata of the other person are not there.[^Zizek]

I here substitute "real people" with artworks and "the whole strata" as the
process which has led to the result that is the artwork; The file. The .wav 
or .pdf for example. Process and method, or even just the nomenclature of the
tools involved, are per default hidden, or purposefully made secret.

> [An] example of how the virtual dimension is operative at the symbolic level
> would have been beliefs. Are we aware to what extent our beliefs today are
> virtual? By virtual I mean, in this case, attributed to others, presupposed.
> They don't actually exist, they are virtual, in the sense that nobody really has
> to believe, we only have to presuppose another person to believe.[^Zizek] 

An example of a virtual symbolic belief in our neck of the woods would be the
story of how Gil Evans arranged _Sketches of Spain_. The story goes that he's a
genius for arranging in such a way that instruments that were very widely apart
in terms of their audibility, were they to be stood on a stage together, could
be made to fit snugly in a mix. Contrastingly there's the story of how a 1930s
first-timer studio musician asked a recording engineer "if there oughtn't be more
than one microphone in the room". The recording engineer then proceeds to laugh
and ask if the musician intends to record more than one record simultaneously.
The recording engineer goes on to explain that whomever in the ensemble has a
solo should take a step closer to the microphone. 

I presuppose that there is a person within an audience which listens to the
result of my organizing of sound filtered through these stories even though I
don't regard them as real from my perspective. I imagine an audience's a priori
established beliefs subsequent effect on their perception of artworks that I
produce. 

In the music that I have produced for this thesis project the presupposition
present in the imagined audience is that acoustic music is created by living
breathing human beings, reading sheet music. They are using a very special type
of physical object, which is a musical instrument, to make sounds. Ideally this
happens in a special type of physical space, which is a concert hall. This is
how recordings get made. The details surrounding the engineering aspect of the
recording is not important. The people in the room with their instruments;
_That_ is where the magic happens. Any infringement upon that fact is
unthinkable, to this imagined audience, which holds these virtual beliefs. This
then becomes Zizek's efficacity, as it gave me something to relate to when I
made the music for this project.

In the lead up to Zizek's great reveal of The Real Real there is the telling of
the story in which Rumsfeld lists what they knew at the time just before the war
on Iraq:

‚Ä¢ The known knows <br>
‚Ä¢ The known unknowns <br>
‚Ä¢ The unknown unknowns <br>

Zizek adds a fourth category to Rumsfeld's list: 

‚Ä¢ Unknown knowns

> We know them, they are part of our identity, they determine our activity, but we
> don't know that we know them! This is what, in psychoanalysis, of course, is
> called unconscious. Unconscious fantasies, unconscious prejudices, etc., etc.
> And I think that this level is crucial.[^Zizek]

I agree that this level is crucial, and add that biases are another wording of
how these unknown knows dictate our behaviour. This wording strongly comes into
focus for me as an expression of our time. Especially as it relates to how a
wider applicability of algorithms in our daily lives has led to concerns about
[the pervasiveness of algorithms](https://www.tiny.cc/1vdg5y). I am obliged to
state the obvious here for the record: All of the algorithms created to date
have been created by humans. _We_ are the one's writing the algorithms. These
are _our_ biases. We bring them with us into everything we do. Even into the act
of listening to music. This is part of why I was drawn to exemplifying, or
possibly even teasing out these biases, or unknown knows, in the music I made in
this thesis project.

I'll let Jacques Lacan speak for himself here via a quote from his seminar
_Freud's Papers on Technique_ in order to give you an example of why I find it
preferable to receive my Lacan through Zizek:

> The real is what resists symbolization absolutely.[^Lacan] 
>

I'll leave this section with an exercise for the reader, to be forever doomed,
just as I have been forever doomed to find Baudrillard's four categories from
_Simulation and Simulacra_, in every aspect of your life from now until
eternity:

‚Ä¢ Faithful copy <br>
‚Ä¢ Mask <br>
‚Ä¢ Illusion <br>
‚Ä¢ Pure simulacrum <br>

No, but seriously though, Corey Mohler asks:

> What is philosophy? 
> It's when you think about something so much that
> you actually end up understanding it less.[^Mohler]

What if reality is not a contiguous field but rather made up of components that
require assembly?

When the simulation becomes indistinguishable from the real, and then, surpasses
the real in expressing potential that was present all along, both in the real
and in the simulation. At that point, where the simulation extends past the
capacities of the real, and becomes preferred over the real, it can begin to
effect the real. Not to change the real, because the real is a moving target,
but better yet, to change the _enactment_ of the real. This enactment then
emanates outward, spreading like wildfire, approaching the point of critical
mass that is the wildly unruly expression of culture. 

If your ears are not occupied listening to the music I made for this thesis
project, then you simply must see Emma Robinson's amazing video depicting a
cover of Rihanna's [Stay](http://www.tiny.cc/29jd5y), using only her voice and a
piano. Expert mimicry of Auto-Tune artifacts using glottal stops and precise
intonation inflections at on-a-dime speeds.

My fascination for this material mirrors the kind of fascination representatives
of american cultural imperialism feel when they hear their distinctly
hyperRealised echo emanating from, for example, Japan. Mimicry is the sincerest
form of flattery, albeit at times eerie or even uncanny when witnessed. This
human being's efforts are directed at an object. I bet it took ten thousand
hours to perfect. The result is a most _exquisite_ mimicry, of which the
receiver, an entirely inanimate machine, is unaware.

<big>**03. The MPC is now a lens**</big>

**The setup**

If the tape recorder was hyperReal then the MPC would be hyperHyperReal (compare
postPostModern) and controlling Kontakt with SuperCollider is infinitely
hyperRealised in comparison to the original origin myth.  

But we can't just run around slapping on an ever increasing number of post and
hyper to words all willy-nilly now can we? That would be ridiculous. Let's check
in with Mark Fisher in _Capitalist Realism_:

> Postmodernism remains a hugely contested term, its meanings, appropriately but
> unhelpfully, unsettled and multiple.[^Fisher]

**A new origin myth**

The myth of Electronic Music's origin, as it was handed down to me, was always
told through the perspective of the tape recorder being the unquestionable
beginning of it all. Then later, the result of that historical perspective sees
the tape recorder grow to the size of the studio, with it's undeniable
monumental prestige. If we adjust the point of departure to a more recent
technological breakthrough, then the scope of our story changes dramatically. To
use the MPC as the starting point for an alternative telling of history emerges
as an opportunity. If we dare to follow this line of thinking further, we arrive
at taking actions in the present, in order to create the kind of future we would
most prefer.

The story we now construct has ramifications for where density occurs within the
story. My preference is for density to occur closer to our time. Year zero is no
longer the end of WWII with that of the Americans "liberating" the tape recorder
from the rubble of continental Europe. Instead, the year is 1988. Public Enemy
burst into a popular culture running at break-neck-speed with their debut
release _It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back_. In _the same year_
N.W.A release _Straight Outta Compton_.

Our origin story is no longer one of first meanderings of applying an alien
technology inside of a void. Instead the very modus operandi is referentiality.
The sampler and sampling, not the tape recorder and tape recordings of trains or
doors and sighs.

As stated above the history of Electronic Music begins with the tape recorder
and then _explodes_ outward into the physical monument of the studio. Our new
origin story is one of _implosion_. From the decisively physical 10,5 Kilos of
the original MPC-60 to the weightlessness of software. Both stories originate
from a single machine but constitutes wildly different points of departure.

I argue that sampler softwares, running inside of computers, are direct
descendants of the MPC. As software they are now devoid of physical form. A
computer can perform the task of any specialized machine like the tape recorder
or the sampler. A general purpose computer is incorporeal. Purpose defined in
software.

**Over embellished symmetry**

It wasn't until much later that I realised that the "magical machine" that I had
heard about was the MPC. I first heard the story when I was a kid listening to
NWA, Public Enemy and De La Soul. Then finally when I was older from a friend
who turned me on to J-Dilla's _Donuts_. He told me the story of how the record
got made as we were listening to the album together. The last celebrated
experimental hip hop record, and it didn't have _any_ rapping on it. The story
goes he made it in the hospital as he was dying of a terminal illness. Had his
MPC3000 on his belly in the hospital bed. I don't know if that's entirely
accurate. That image is strong that I've put off trying to find out if it's a
100% true story because

> A kiss may not be the truth but it's what we wish were true.
>[^LAstory]

That's another bit from Steve Martin's _LA Story_. In the film I think we're
meant to think it's a Shakespeare quote. I very much enjoy how in the film there
are all kinds of subtleties at work drawing lines between high and low
expressions of culture.

There might be a way to way to fit the John Cage on tour in Europe with Earl
Brown and Christian Wolff story in here. Bear with me here. The story goes that,
they were all on tour together, and their musics all utilized the idea that if
there is a sufficient amount of silence in between notes, then the listener will
forget the previous note. John Cage finds that after hearing the same program
being played night after night, in city after city, he begins to hear melodies
in all of their pieces. Prolonged exposure. Even just practice. It ends up in
your memory even if you don't want it to. Cage focused on just the notes in this
example. To my mind there would have still been the compounded infinities of
timbre and timing.  With the MPC in it's first iteration I'm thinking this was
most apparent. Hit that pad and get exactly the same sound every time. Later
models in my time have been marketed as having velocity through pressure
sensitivity built into the pads. Not sure but I think they returned to the flat
no dynamics thing when they made an iOS version. The MPC is then an expression
of acorporeality as Egan uses the word in _Diaspora_, reduced to pictures under
glass. The retriggering anyway, The "machineGunning". That's actually what made
the MPC so interesting to me. It was how it was _perceived_. Lifeless, or even
undead, like a zombie. The corpse moves, and in such marvellously different
ways.

**The old hat paradox**

Sampling as a radical act? Sampling is something I am certain that we would be
well served to readdress, in both thinking and practice. Here then maybe we
could entertain the idea that there were possibilities presented to artists in
the past, in the form of a very special brush, that for whatever reason have
been insufficiently explored. Paradoxically taking on the role of the old hat at
the same time. FM certainly is like that. Additive Synthesis as well. These two
examples can easily be thought of through a purely technical perspective. Since
both FM and Additive Synthesis offer an apparent abundance in the parameter
space, it becomes a problem of organizing efforts to explore them in powerful
(abstracted) ways. We are left to our own devices here. We are not posing a
threat to anyone noodling around inside of our belly buttons engaging with this
work. On the other hand sampling isn't comparatively as underexplored from a
technical perspective. Might could be that there's a case to be made about how
sampling is underexplored from a _referential_ and _social_ perspective.
This is largely due to how fraught with legal concerns sampling became. There
was, I think, a panic that spread quickly. A scrambling then ensued to
safeguard intellectual property belonging to large corporations.

**Curs√©d sampler** 

A strange kind of cult following has since then crept up around the hardware.
Compare this to the specialized Early Music instruments that contemporary
practitioners utilize. As these sought after hardwares are no longer in
production, the secondhand market is of course where folks looking to live the
dream end up. The problem of sellers setting their wares apart from the rest
arises. The solution is now, as it always was, the narrative: 

> Possibly Cursed Emu SP1200 Reissue Modified Sampler - $500 (Seattle)<br><br>
> This SP-1200 belonged to my former roommate who bought it for $500 from a woman

The above ad text reproduced here in it's entirety taken from Seattle
CraigsList. I am especially fond of how the writer (which the site has
anonymized) manages to make the no haggling over the price requirement an
integral part of the narrative itself.

**Promises have been made**

Why do I feel it is important to include my code in this thesis, you ask? In a
word: Utility. I also feel that some degree of responsibility needs to be taken
when occupying a space, and when speaking while one's voice is amplified by
context. That context in my case is academia. This is me owning up to the
promise of not surrendering to capitalist logic.

Mark Fisher had this to say in _Capitalist Realism_: 

> For most people under twenty in Europe and North America, the lack of

> occupies the horizons of the thinkable. Jameson used to report in horror about

**Workspace and environment**

I borrowed this subheader from my favourite part of [Trash

interviews under this name. My favourite one, is the interview with [Valance
Drakes](https://www.tiny.cc/n5zg5y), which to me, stands out from the rest. In
this interview the series' focus on workspace inadvertently ends up depicting
class. To my ears, purchasing power usually inversely correlates to creativity.

Here's a picture of my screen depicting one of the pieces I made for this thesis
project. This is written in a (domain specific) language called
[TidalCycles](https://www.tiny.cc/369g5y) (fingers crossed it's still there in
the future when you read this). I'm running a vim plugin called
[TidalVim](https://www.tiny.cc/6n9g5y) inside of
[NeoVim](https://www.tiny.cc/5r9g5y) which is a modal text editor.
[Kitty](https://www.tiny.cc/ew9g5y) is my terminal emulator. This is one of the
pieces I wrote earlier in the process of putting together this thesis project.

This is the _before image_:

Here's another picture of my screen depicting a different piece I made for this
thesis project. This is written in a language called
[SuperCollider](https://www.tiny.cc/4vah5y) which is mainly an object oriented
language but you _can_ write functionally in it also, if that is your thing.
I've previously alluded to my not knowing why anyone would want to do that. This
is an entirely too strange hill for me to die on. Just let it go! Ok? Try not to
think about. I'm running a Vim plugin called
[scnvim](https://www.tiny.cc/a2ah5y) inside of NeoVim which is still the same
modal text editor as above. Kitty is still the terminal emulator of choice for
the discerning user or admin.

I would like to return the shine, as it were, to the task of organising sound in
general and to working with algorithmic composition in particular. 
Stretch goals would be to influence people to join me in rewiring the term
Computer Music to hold a new meaning. One tailored specifically to fit our time.
As computers are no longer held in artificial scarcity but rather available in
abundance new ways of thinking and acting in the world are possible.

**The Believing Game**

I'd like to change your mind, about everything you know in your heart of hearts
to be true. 

When I was a kid, I would sometimes stare for long stretches of time
at high ceilings, imagining what it would be like, to be in that upside down world
in the ceiling. To walk around up there, looking up at the world down here. For
everything to be so different, about the way we perceive this place, where we
are now. You are reluctant to have your perspective changed. Your world views
are pretty much set. Let's play a game you and I. It's called: The Believing
Game.

Peter Elbow, Professor Emeritus of English at University of Massachusetts,
Amherst, writes in a draft for an essay entitled _The Believing
Game--Methodological Believing_: 

> I still struggle with how to name it. In my second essay, I tried a fancier more
> theoretically self-conscious term, calling it "methodological believing".
> But then I worried that this was needlessly pretentious--and I like the
> irreverence of "game". Yet now as I write this essay,
> "methodological" seems central.[^Elbow] 

I also struggle tremendously with tone in language all of the time. The _way_ I
say something begins with the choice of which words to use. The effect of these
choices lead to inclusions and exclusions of different kinds of folks. I suppose
in some ways this text attempts to straddle the two hemispheres (The
Academic and... the other one). If it reads anywhere near as conflicted about
the matter as I feel as I write this, then maybe that is "showing by doing". I
really don't know.

> I can define the believing game most easily and clearly by contrasting it with
> the doubting game. Indeed, the believing game derives from the doubting game.[^Elbow]

I love comparisons. They're great. If you set them up just right, they can be
_very_ convincing.

> The _doubting game_ represents the kind of thinking most widely honored and taught

I am all for running experiments and putting the results we get under a
microscope.

> In contrast, the _believing game_ is the disciplined practice of trying to be as
> welcoming or accepting as possible to every idea we encounter: not just

I am aware that my bouncing around getting all creative with the "form" of this
text puts me at risk of failure to complete my duties towards academia. Fingers
crossed I guess.

> As the rhetoric of experience, the believing game [teaches us] to try to
> understand points of view from the inside. Words can help us here, but the kind

The poetic wavelength fascinates me. The lived experience often does not lend
itself very well to explaining. Phenomenon arise and recede. We are mildly aware
only to an extent. Experiences ever mounting, upwards and outwards, constructing
the self, seemingly without our concious involvement. Life, happening, while we
are busying ourselves, constructing thoughtful analyses.

> Because of the dominance of critical thinking, especially in the academy,

Oh hey, here's that "idiot's version of being interesting" thing from before.

Thinking about the _way_ that we think is difficult, but necessary. It might
even be harder to get clear about that than about what words to use. That would
be a difficult comparison. Let's compare two kinds of narratives, or lenses,
instead.  A historic account, like an origin myth, and a Grand Vision of The
Future. It has always been my strong conviction that the former constricts ways
of thinking about the future, and that the latter _expands_ it.

**Oram's New Atlantis** 

I keep coming back to this passage from Francis Bacon's _The New Atlantis_ which was
first published in 1623:

> We have also sound-houses, where we practise and demonstrate all sounds, and
> their generation. We have harmonies which you have not, of quarter-sounds, and
> lesser slides of sounds. Divers instruments of music likewise to you unknown,
> some sweeter than any you have, together with bells and rings that are dainty
> and sweet. We represent small sounds as great and deep; likewise great sounds
> extenuate and sharp; we make divers tremblings and warblings of sounds, which in
> their original are entire. We represent and imitate all articulate sounds and
> letters, and the voices and notes of beasts and birds. We have certain helps
> which set to the ear do further the hearing greatly. We have also divers strange
> and artificial echoes, reflecting the voice many times, and as it were tossing
> it: and some that give back the voice louder than it came, some shriller, and
> some deeper; yea, some rendering the voice differing in the letters or
> articulate sound from that they receive. We have also means to convey sounds in
> trunks and pipes, in strange lines and distances.[^Bacon]

That's some story. Actually, for me it's a story wrapped in another story.
Daphne Oram put that quote on a door at The BBC Radiophonic Workshop and
_that's_ the story I've been told.

Mark Fisher writes in _Capitalist Realism_:

> It was [the] BBC that also funded the popular avant gardism of the BBC
> Radiophonic Workshop, which embedded sonic experimentalism into everyday life.
> Such innovations are unthinkable now that the public has been displaced by the
> consumer.[^Fisher]

I remember hearing Oram dream about The Oramics Machine in a radio program
Produced by Ian Chambers for TX BBC Radio 3. It was broadcasted on Sunday the
3rd of August, 2008. The broadcast celebrated the 50th anniversary of the
creation of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop.  

Daphne Oram explains:

> I have a new technique ... one that I've evolved over the years, and it's still
> evolving ... I'm interested in being able to manipulate sound. To give every
> subtle nuance that I want ... I am finding that what one has to do is to pick
> out each parameter separately ...I believe my father said that when I was seven
> years old I was predicting that one day I would have a marvelous new machine
> that would make any sound I wanted.[^Oram]

I feel tremendous gratitude that I possess consciousness at a point in time, and
a place in the world, where The General Purpose Computer is not only a reality
but readily available in veritable abundance. A friend of mine found a working
laptop in a tech-trash room four years ago and is still using it to make music
at the time of writing. If you can, then how about you take five minutes right
now to see if you can rescue something that has been thrown away. It's a very
empowering feeling.

**Rooms are resonant bodies**

There is an absurdity and a poetic quality to our acts of imagining that
fascinates me. I invite you to imagine someone, at one time having believed that
a photograph, could steal a soul.

Through working on this thesis project I've felt increasingly at risk of giving
in, to the temptation of magical thinking. This particular flavour of cognitive
distortion was the least likely one, I thought. I always saw myself as more of a
Polarized Thinking type of person If I had to choose _one_. I thought I knew who
I was here, when measuring only within this narrow band of inquiry, an isolated
parameter. I keep saying that any sufficiently advanced technology is
indistinguishable from magic. I never thought I'd be on the receiving end of
that one, at least not while working on my own music.

_Convolution_ is the technology that most made me feel like I was loosing my
grip on reality. Subconsciously at first. Then growing, and spilling over into
concious reflection. Towards the end, I was increasingly unsure about my
footing. I began to entertain the idea that this sense of uncertainty was
connected to my confusion about my _class identity_.

When I worked as stage manager at
[Norbergfestival](https://www.tiny.cc/6guh5y)'s largest stage, Mimer (it was
unpaid volunteer work) I had a couple of opportunities to make some convolution
files of the space. It's a huge concrete building. It used to be an iron ore
enrichment plant connected to the mine. The tone of the room is just
breathtaking. I carried that room with me in my computer afterwards and used it
every now and then. I didn't realize at the time how profoundly the experience
of making the convolution files had effected me. This is meant to be a purely
technical task. Then some time later, during a residency at St√§llberg, which is
also an old mine, Mats Erlandsson and David Granstr√∂m made convolutions of The
Machine Hall and gave me the files. 

It was right under my nose then, but it still took me quite a while to piece the
puzzle together. I know that It is entirely impossible for the "narrative
component" of which space I use in the music I make to somehow travel the
distance to the listener all on it's own. I understand now, that it's different
for me. I've been there. I know the name of the convolution file. When I choose
that room, I am, as if by magic, transported there. I can't help but start to
imagine the workers there. Through a wrinkle in time, toiling ceaselessly,
dutifully. Now that the lightning has been caught in the bottle, I can't help
but imagine the work, that once filled those rooms with sound. From the lowest
rumbles, through the spectrum all the way up the ladder to the harshest height
of the audible. At the end of it we subtract time and we've captured, if not the
room itself then it's essence, or if you care to indulge me, it's soul.

My imaginings (or my mind playing tricks on me) have been centered on _work_. As
the type of work that happened in the mines is quickly becoming more and more of
a rare occurrence in our time and place. We are visited by emissaries of the
past, passionately relating to us, stories about the work that took place there.
The gruesome conditions, the undeniable physicality of it all. Those stories
start to feel a lot more real than the type of work we're doing now. Creative
work, or cognitive work even. For example, my paying a membership fee to a
special kind of "physical labour simulator" starts to seem utterly absurd (Zizek
would have a field day with my sad realisation).

That kind of _real_ work happened there. In that place. It's not something that
I can really understand. There will never be enough time for that, as time is
always passing. Racing ever more quickly now, it seems. My own origin myth will
always elude me. "If these walls could talk" we say. My thoughts connect
disparate elements, and make patterns. 

Compare another cavernous room tone; The church. A place of worship. A place to
wonder in awe of god's greatness. The organ was the first big organised sound,
filling the space and making it seem even more monumental. That room tone is
part of how we've heard that instrument, I realized when I was making
recordings, to turn into samples for this project. The resonance is a vital
part of how we identify that instrument. Place and narrative intersect, in the
tone of the room. As the room resonates _we_ are brought into resonance with
_ideas_. 

I never believed in god. To me it was always just narrative vehicle that was
useful at the time, to spread some basic concepts about human interaction, like
"clean you hands and try not to kill anyone". But _work_ though, that was, at
least at one time, real. The workers were real. Despite of how they're identity
as a group now seems to be at risk of being erased by an ever increasing number
of neoliberal projects. Projects that end up wearing the tell-tale signs of
conspiracy (but surely a conspiracy couldn't be real, could it?). The struggle
for workers rights leading to the forming of unions was real. That was always a
very strong component of any narrative at home when I was growing up. It is such
a sad state of affairs to see the power of unions continuously eroded now. It
feels so unreal. I am emotionally distraught. I spiral helplessly into anxiety
about capitalism-induced climate disaster, and then I'm utterly lost, to a
strangling feeling. I can't breath! Where do human beings fit into this present
nightmare of how the real manifests itself through quarterly earnings reports.
All around us. An all encompassing blanket of _Unheimlichkeit_, totally
enveloping the world, shutting out all light. Darkness has me. I am lost to it.
I wish there was a way I could make sense of it all. To be able to _reason_ my
way out of feeling.

**State is immeasurable**

This subheader alludes to the observer effect in Physics where attempting to
make measurements invariably leads to changes in the situation or phenomenon you
are observing. Live Coding is at once both a situation and somewhat of a
phenomenon. Here's an excellent example of [live
coding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiEq_h5UQJM)

In this thesis project my code is static. This stands in contrast to how things
are done within Live Coding. Why is that important? A frozen state, that holds
the capacity to yield a multitude of infinities, expressed in immeasurable
variation as the intricate clockwork diligently passes through time. That sort
of thing fascinates me. It always has. To construct something and then for it to
take on a life of it's own in a sense. That feels paradoxical doesn't it? This
then goes on to say something interesting about complexity. Namely that the
scope, or, put another way, the sampling window, matters when we aim to assess
complexity. 

Is it static or is it in flux? I guess it also has something to do with the
presentation aspect of the work. I work on the code until it reaches a static
state which is most to my liking. While I might not listen to an eternity's
worth of the generated material, I'll listen to a good long while. I can be
certain that the algorithms combining of parameter values will continue to
satisfy me in the same way that I can hear when a piece is finished. My choice
to present static code in combination with fixed media is for the greater part
due to my fascination for complexity emerging out of simplicity. It's a feeling.
You'll have to take my word for the existence of that internal emotional state. 

**A differing perspective on smallness**

To a smaller degree it's also due to the fact that I can't help but go against
the prescribed modus operandi of playing the code, within Live Coding, like an
instrument. I'm like that a lot of the time. I just don't like being told what
to do I guess. 

I want to organise sound in a very specific way. To collapse the wavefront. To
affix the indefinite. To transform it into the definitive. Another nice aspect
of static code is that it greatly increases portability. This is important to
me.

I want to use code to compose. I don't want to play the code like an instrument.
I compare this to  preferring to compose over playing the guitar. Nothing wrong
with playing the guitar, I do that all of the time. I just prefer to compose is
all.

When I say "We're not ready for it", I don't mean that Live Coding is so
futureWorld that it, as a "cultural phenomenon", is ahead of it's time. It has
in fact existed for quite some time, although that is all very dependent on how
you define the criteria. What I'm saying is that we don't have the fundamentals
of the infrastructure for even just the creation of the kind of files that can
be distributed in a way that makes sense. Video is a really bad way of making
code available to others. The recipient can't copy the code out of the video
file and has to try to write it by hand. This is error prone and clunky. Also
video file sizes are huge. Static code however is just a tiny text file.
Kilobytes. Goes anywhere fast because it is so tiny. David and Goliath. There's
another story for you, and you know how that one turned out.

I got to thinking about state a lot through brushing up against functional
programming. In functional programming state is thought of as something dirty
and dangerous. That, of course, makes it interesting to me. I found workarounds
because it was fun to go against prescribed ways of working. It's that thing
from before about limitations within frameworks again. Also I'd argue that
memory is a fundamental aspect of music as it is a time based medium. You simply
can not say stuff like "There is no state", or that "Time is the only constant"
and not expect people to rise up in rebellion to dethrone and kill you, burn
down your church and take a leak on the ashes while laughing like a raving
lunatic. This is just how the world works. Tough cookies.

Anyway the whole "wanting to stay 100% squeaky clean all of the time thing",
that can happen to functional programmers, always struck me as having more to do
with fundamental problems in computer science, than about me wanting to organise
sound. Never mind about all of that. I don't mind so much that there could
potentially be a danger of some unexpected behaviour when I'm making music by
writing code. I spend a lot more time _listening_ to musical results than I do
expecting to hear things. So as long as it makes a sound there is something for me
to hear, and most importantly, to decide what I think of it. I only ever
regarded unintended silence as failure. Anything above that is something I can
work with. If I can hear it, I am certain that I can decide if I like it or not.
How could I not have an opinion on anything and everything I hear? As far back
as I can remember that's all I've been doing. Deciding. Making choices based on
what I've been hearing. So it's real simple. I like simple. So does Mark Fell,
and I like Mark Fell:

> It's all dead simple, I have no real interest in technical complexity, and this
> music has a streamlined quality I admire. No gesture is strained or wasted and
> the music is complex, the technology is simple, a better way round than the age
> old problem of academic electronic music where muscular technology too often
> produces pissweak sounds.[^Fell]

If I try hard I can still remember that the task of organising sound felt
daunting to me in the beginning. I would think about the infinite possibilities
of combinatorics and a general dread of the blank page would sneak up on me and
I'd get all wound up. I like to keep things simple. Usually I don't notice that
I've started composing for real until much later. I thought I was just trying to
figure out how something worked. I change one thing at a time, and I listen. If
I like what I hear, having tweaked that one parameter, I'll move on to the next
one. Complexity could yield itself later through the compounding of many simple
choices. I don't go after complexity. I don't shy away from it either. It could
happen and that would be ok so long as I like what I'm hearing. Simple. Reduced
both in terms of thinking about emergence of complexity and also about the work
as just another craft. Do a thing many times in order to get apt at doing
that thing.

<big>**06. Music is a technology**</big>

<br>

The title of this section is a remix of Anthony Rother's 2005 album _Art is a
technology_. I liked that album. Apart from the way it sounded, and how that made
me feel, I liked it because it was at once the most prominent example of "Modular
Music" that I have ever heard, and at the same time managed to transcend the genre
entirely. I like it when albums do that.

My first concious choice at the inception of this thesis project was that I
wrote code in order to make all of the pieces. This was important to me because,
like I said, I want to actively participate in recontextualizing the term
Computer Music. This term comes from a time where computers where rare, and the
utilizing of this scarce resource towards the goal of making music was even
rarer. At the time of this writing computers are ubiquitous (in the global west,
I know, I am very much in favor of adding The Right to Computation to [The
List](tiny.cc/e2x84y)).

**Putting on a show**

On April 6th of 2019, at Fylkingen, which is the national venue for weird music,
in Stockholm, Sweden, I premiered a bunch of music that I had made during the last year
or so. I made a lot of little choices about the details surrounding this
manifestation of the work. This compounding of little choices is very important
to me. You've heard the expression "The Devil is in the details". I subscribe to
that idea fully.

There were three sets. I've been a part of putting together a lot of shows at
Fylkingen, in a lot of different capacitites and, I have found that this format is
my preference. Each set was 40 minutes, and there were two 20 minute breathers in
between the sets. I find that this makes it doable from a technical perspective.
Longer, and or more, sets are not my preference within this "Fylkingen Show"
framework.

I choose to do the show on a Saturday afternoon. My thinking there was that, I
wanted it to be possible for a person who works a full time job, with regular
hours, to attend. I chose the afternoon instead of the default evening time
because I didn't want to have the bar open. The reason I didn't want to have the
bar open is because I don't drink. Also I didn't want to sell anything. Not that
day. I find that the default behaviour of everyone drinking at shows is not
conducive to listening. There is also the larger issue of sustainability.

Destructive behaviour like the use of depressants like alcohol is not
sustainable, and obviously toxic, despite of what our culture dictates. So instead
of selling alcohol, I treated my audience to the same green tea and fruit that
had sustained me through the completion of this thesis project. If you ask me, I
thought that was a nice touch.

More importantly (what could be more important than Sencha?) the sound files I
created where all Stereo sound files. They were diffused in a larger speaker
array by Mats Erlandsson in the most exquisitely subtle way imaginable. The width
of the Stereo files were enhanced and the music really came to life and filled
the room. Mats tailored the colour (EQ), and amplitude of each component piece, to
the particular responses of the room. The sound files were accompanied by
projection of the code I used to make the particular piece.

Especially in the first set, I felt the need to do some "onBoarding" (intentional
use of gratuitous business jargon), so I did it using excerpts from this text,
read by speech synthesis. I spent way to much time on giving these virtual
voices "direction". I suspect that the underlying technology is concatenative
synthesis so in a lot of ways it has the same kind of characteristic "tells"
that playing back a limited set of samples of instruments does. Just like with
the music I found myself wanting to navigate this topography of "tells". I made
decisions about whether I wanted to go with, or against the input from the voices
I used. Should I allow the actors to "give the game away"? Do I add or subtract
from the sense that theses voices were something more complicated than just
plain old boring vanilla, _real_.

While working with the resultant sounds from having giving these virtual actors
"direction", through the use of special charcters that the speech synthesis
engine responds to in order to shorten or extend pauses, lessen or intensify
emphasis etc. I began to anthropomorphize uncontrollably. It was a trip. While
on the subject of trips, here's an account which was related to me after the
show by a member of the audience. This person had at first thought that I was on
the stage, then realized that it was a fake head, then become convinced that it
had moved. Then, she said with eyes widening, the silhouette had changed the ear
into a nose and the face from a man's to a woman's. It was just a backlit
styrofoam head draped in a black veil. In the absence of visual stimuli we start
to see things that are not there. It may be due to feedback in the pattern
recognition part of our brains, who can know these things?

American theoretical physicist Richard Feynman reminds us to exercise caution
when fawning over science in _The Pleasure of Finding Things Out_:

> ... statements of science are not of what is true and what is not true, but
> statements of what is known with different degrees of certainty.[^Feynman]

**Set lists**

**Briefly on the subject of recording sound**

Take your fingers right up to your ears. As close as you can get them without
touching your ears. Now rub your fingers together ever so gently. You can hear
that can't you? Now imagine trying to hear such a faint sound across from a
concert hall or even just a stage. You would not be able to. Now imagine an
orchestra. Something close to a hundred people. They wouldn't be able to fit
there with all of their instruments in that close proximity where you heard that
faint sound of your fingers rubbing together just now. Right there is where I
put the microphone. Each time, as close as I can get it. It's the place were a
lover whispers to you. For each instrument and sometimes even changing the
placement to optimize fully for a particular articulation. We are taught that
close proximity is dangerous and can lead to an exaggerated low end. I have
found that it is easier and sounds better to subtract from a signal rather than
to add to it. Anyone who knows me knows that I have a strong preference for the
lower end of the audible spectrum. If need be, cut the bass and add any room
you like later, in post. Get as much of the signal as you can when you have it
in front of you. Just make sure it doesn't clip, is the kicker though.

**Uroboros's clenched jaw**

Leading up to the show I, of course, started to feel more and more agonizingly
pressed for time, as is always the case with me. I began to realize that I had
complicated matters many times over the course of the project by wanting both
the text and the music to be referential to each other in various ways. It
became the age old problem of Catch 22. The text needed to already be finished
in order for me to bring myself to finish the music and, vice versa. The myth of
[Uroboros](http://www.tiny.cc/3uni5y) sprang to mind. I could neither stop time,
nor step out of it. No matter how I struggled with Uroboros's clenched jaw, I
could not pry it open. When all of this was at it's worst I began to loose my
grip on what has always been most important to me. The _conceptual_ had begun to
effect the _perceptual_. I got all wound up in thinking about my music that my
music started to sound like shit to me. It was very frustrating and I had to
delete a bunch of music because I felt it was posturing, and utterly lost in the
intoxication of constructivist beauty.

> Nothing is real, everything is permitted.

William S. Burroughs would have us believe that the source for this quote
is:

> Last words [of] Hassan Sabbah. The Old Man of the Mountain quoted from 
> _The Master of the Assassins_ by Betty Bouthoul.[^Taylor] 

Taken from Burroughs's _Minutes to Go_. 

This quote keeps popping up all over the pace. Later on in a video game called
Assassin's Creed. Everyone is sampling it. The origin is more blurred by every
use of it. It especially effects searchability on the commercial internet as the
search engine (you know which one, the dominant one) is "optimizing" by finding
and fanning flames into resonances. When a resonance becomes feedback it can be
used as a new signal to replace the old one. True origins are being overwritten.

Preferences of style exist, aesthetics do not. Just as there is no god there can
be no divine beauty. We are left to our own devices down here. We have to make
up our own minds about what we prefer. Not much else to it really.

So the gist of this text is this: During my Master which was 2017 to 2019 I
changed my way of working with music in a few different ways. A big part of it was
changing some of the tools I use. New tools, new capabilites, new _freedoms_. I
regard nomenclature as an important first step towards transparency. So here's a
quick recap of what has changed:

I went from using TidalCycles to using SuperCollider as the language. From
using SuperDirt as my sampler to instead using Kontakt. From using AudioMulch
to using Reaper for real time post production.

So some of the names of the tools changed but the functionality broadly speaking
stayed the same. The modus operandi is still:

Write code, that triggers samples. Then, apply effects in some kind of DAW-like
environment.

This is what I do, in order to express my musical ideas. Why should I express my
musical ideas? Because I want to, and because I can. The possibility exists and
I am drawn to it. The way I make music is dependant on tools. The tools should
be open for others to study and use. If I don't take measures to make my tools
available to others then I see myself kicking out the rungs beneath me as I
climb upward. I can't bear that. This is a process which has not fully reached
it's end state. I am embarrassed by my dependence on commercial software. It
should all be open source by now, but, it isn't. I make excuses, none of which
are any good, for why I am not fully open source. My most commonly used excuse
is that I am pressed for time.

On a conceptual or extra musical level I am obliged to admit, however
reluctantly, that something changed. Anyone who knows me is always hearing me
tell the same story. About how fundamentally music is incapable of depicting
anything because of the fact that it is inherently abstract and utterly
ephemeral. If someone _does_ tell a story, I keep saying, it's usually because
they are selling something. One of my favourite stories is the one about how
Vivaldi was a publisher. In Vivaldi's time, sheet music was the product. The
story goes that Vivaldi was able to sustain himself as an artist because he was
so good at also being a publisher who knew how to sell sheet music. What Vivaldi
had figured out, is that narrative sells. The alleged evidence for this is that
Vivaldi had already tried and failed to sell the music he later collected as The
Four Seasons. This story above all cements for me the unlikeliness that
programme music will be real. It will most likely be a marketing ploy to peddle
goods of some kind. 

Despite of how many times I have told that story both to myself, to my friends
and basically anyone within earshot, I ended up making a strange kind of
programme music myself. I got to thinking, perhaps too much, about my
environment, and about the people I met there. How they work, and also about why
they work in the ways that they work, and ultimately, what their goals are. The
project ended up describing my thoughts and emotions about being back in that
old world. Feeling much the same way as before. Like a prole at a cocktail
party, trying to blend in, eating cucumber hors d'oeuvres and failing to
exchange pleasantries, sweating profusely, certain of being found out and
politely asked to leave, any second now. 

What if reality is so choke full of individualists with an exaggerated sense of
agency, infinitely doubling down on past self deceptions so avidly that no
semblance of reality can be salvaged?

I've come to realize that most of all, this thesis project was about learning to
cope with cognitive dissonance.

I've learned a lot from working on this thesis project. It's been very freeing
in a lot of ways. I feel like I "got over myself", in at least some respects. It
is my feeling that I addressed and was able to power through some issues. I am
very grateful for the opportunity to do so. I spent a lot longer than I usually
do coming back to pieces, adding to, and changing things. I know that doesn't
matter though. What I mean to say is: No one can ever hear how long any piece of
music took to write. How much effort went into making it. How much struggle. How
many demons overcome. Sound is just wiggly air. It is also my favourite thing to
do with the time that I have. Also I don't think I'm hurting anyone. So that's
what I'm doing. Making the air wiggle in a particular way that interests me,
here, in The Right Now. 

This isn't my last rodeo. Even though I definitely got entirely carried away
with this thesis project and it kind of blew up on me, I'd hate to ever have to
go through the experience of outside pressure to stay on brand. Compare
type-casting in film. An equivalent example would be the type-casting of Steve
Reich as The Quintessential American Minimalist. The trick here is to imagine
Reich as happy. Just like how we do with Sisyphus.

**My Last Rodeo**

What would My Last Rodeo be like? I imagine a decidedly more musical equivalent
to the ending of _Diaspora_ but with the same premise. The point at which time's
passing is no longer a threat. It would be _way_ better than indefinite lifespan
to be entirely certain of safety. The ultimate safe space is all encompassing.
That would mean collecting all of the energy from all of the suns, probably
using something like [Dyson Spheres](tiny.cc/rava5y). All of the mass within our
light cone would have been turned into [Computronium](tiny.cc/aova5y) at this
point. 

Eventually there would be world building. Creating universes is a tall ask.
Maybe we could try utilizing quantum entanglement applied to black holes as a
starting point for computation. Throw one bit in the hole and keep the other bit
for measurement. It would be a start anyway. It would have to be worked out.
Large tasks like this one wouldn't be at all different to smaller tasks. With
time out of the equation, me and who ever else was interested would pool our
energy allotments and, just keep grinding until it was done.

These universes then would have to be filled with the initial conditions
necessary for conciousness to emerge. That would keep me busy for a while I
think. Next would be tweaking those initial conditions until I started hearing
some interesting results. It would be a substantially larger parameter space
than the one I enjoyed exploring in this thesis project. I look forward to this
challenge.

This is my favourite story about the future. Stories about the future are a
special category of story. I included it because I want you to be certain of my
foreseeing working on all kinds of different projects, in between this one and,
My Last Rodeo.

Thank you for reading. That is all.

**A word or two about links**

Below here are some materials I have gathered in an attempt to make things
easier for the kind of person who is curious about sources. Here's the thing
about the internet: It's fickle and frail. "Bit rot" is an ever increasing
likelihood. What I mean by that is that, I have taken steps to ensure that the
things I link to, will deliver on the content I wanted to link to. Archive.org's
WayBack Machine is a great tool for this kind of thing. It's been around since
2001. What it does is let you make a snapshot of what a web page looked like, at
a certain point in time. It is possible to have many snapshots, so you could
potentially describe how a website changed as time progressed through the eons.

Another, related strategy, that I have utilized in order to increase the
likelihood of the availability of outside materials, is .pdf files. Pdfs are
great. They can do a lot of stuff. They'll let you embed fonts. They also
support links and all kinds of other neat stuff that kind of make them like web
pages. There's one important difference to web pages though. They are one
consolidated file containing everything, so that makes them extremely portable.

Portability is a big thing for me. That's why, when it has been possible, I have
have made a copy of the .pdf and stored it in a place that I know that I can
without fail, trust. The links below that end with .pdf will let you download
your own copy of that .pdf. Every copy is a new original because it's digital.
The more copies of a file there are, the more likely it is to survive the [heat
death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_aOIA-vyBo) of the universe. I think
[UbuWeb](https://www.ubu.com) said it best:

> If you love something. download it, it might not be there forever.[^ubuweb]
> 

There are other links below. I've done these on a case by case basis where the
goal has been to keep you safe and shielded, from commercial forces in general,
and sites that track you in particular. For example, in the instances where I
have linked to birdSite I have made use of a tool called
[textise.net](https://www.textise.net/) which transforms any web page into
exclusively text. A .txt file can not track you and algorithmically tailor ads
to sell you things you don't need. If you have ever visited birdSite the
textised version might look a little weird at first but, you get used to it.
Most importantly, the text that I have quoted is preserved there, in a way that
is harmless to you. As an added bonus it is significantly less data-intensive,
and no longer a dopamine-fueled candy-land of bright colours and blinking lights
devouring your soul at the very moment when you are at your weakest.

At the time of writing I am still researching a way to _perfectly_ implement
Richard Stallman's vision of all users right to filter their experience on the
internet. Let me walk you through what I have put together so far.

[Brave](https://brave.com/) is an open source browser that is an ok option right
out of the box for filtering, or put another way, customizing our experience on
the internet.

Brave allows you to use an extension called 
[uBlock origin](http://www.tiny.cc/qnhd5y),
which is designed to protect you from ads.

uBlock origin allows you to use a custom list of elements contained within web
pages to block.

You can download the custom list that I have prepared for you
[here](uBlockList.txt). This list makes it possible for you to view these
sources the way that I would prefer that you view them. Let me be the first to
admit that this approach is experimental. While it might not suit _everyone_, I
do however like to think that it clearly shows intent, and direction going forward.
