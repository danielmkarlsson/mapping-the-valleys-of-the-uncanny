<big>**01. Establishing a baseline**</big>    

Let's start simple. I like simple. In this text I am going to be citing other
texts. I am citing other texts partly because I think that it is a thing that
people do when they write master theses. The other part of why I'm citing other
texts is because it reminds me of sampling. I am interested in sampling. We'll
get to why I think sampling and subsequently citing other texts in this thesis
is interesting but for now it's important to me that you know why I cite. I do
it because in my mind I am actually playing back a sample. It's a sample
containing text instead of sound. You are now ready to receive my first citation.

Steve Martin wrote the script for _LA Story_ and in that film he also plays the
main character Harris K. Telemacher who addresses his unrequited love this way: 

> All I'm saying is that, when I'm around you, I find myself showing off, which
> is the idiot's version of being interesting.[^Martin]

When I am citing other texts I am not doing it to try to impress you. I am not
saying that I think anyone else's way of doing this is bad or anything. All I'm
saying is that, when I'm writing this, I find myself performing and, in that
performing, relating to ideas I have about other people's expectations. Long
story short; I guess you could say I have issues. These issues are mine. It's
not you, it's me.

Greg Egan writes in _Diaspora_:

> Every orphan was an explorer, sent to map uncharted territory. And every orphan
> was the uncharted territory itself.[^Egan]

You knew this already, but all of the quotes that I use can be traced back to
their origins. There you would find the complete body of work of their
creator. We're establishing a baseline here remember? I included the above quote
because it's from my favourite book. The reason it is my favourite book is
because it is a complete recounting of all of our yet unlived communal future,
as a utopia. I like to think that this says something about me and also about my
sensibilities. We could keep playing it this way. My liking something could be a
basis for inclusion. You might be able to piece together something towards an
understanding of my influences this way. 

Karl Marx writes in _Theses on Feuerbach_: 

> The philosophers have only _interpreted_ the world in various ways ; the point,
> however, is to _change_ it.[^Marx]

The above quote tells you for sure that I am at least a socialist, if you hadn't
picked up on that vibe prior to this explicit evidence. It also says something
about how I'm fond of the idea that any pattern can be broken. Anything and
everything is subject to change. The "world" here is dependent on the scope we
apply to it. You can have your pick here whether or not it is literal as in the
planet's impending demise due to capitalism-induced climate disaster and
subsequent resource wars, _or_ given the terrifying nature of that particular
avenue of thought you might prefer one of the smaller scopes, e.g. The
Enlightenment, Academia, Artistic Research within new music, etc. 

**Public Service Announcement**

I should state that I'm not attempting to put forth rigorous proof of anything.
An example of an open problem requiring rigorous proof would be something like
"Can there be a logical solution to the creation of benevolent General
Artificial Intelligence under provably safe conditions?" That would be a
Computer Science paper. This text, although not directly engaged in the
prodction of scientific knowlege, does however aim to be of _use_. More on
utility later. That would probably happen on a Doctoral level (or above even?).
This is not that. This is artistic research and as such a single collapsing of a
wavefront within a form of expression which is not yet fully formed and still
coming into being. There is quite a bit of wiggle room here and I intend to make
ample use of it because, as we'll come back to, freedoms and liberties interest
me. 

I've been a composer for a while now. I've been involved with music in a lot of
different ways through the course of getting to where I'm at now, in this
moment, that has me writing this text. There have been different frameworks at
different times and those different frameworks have all come bundled with their
own distinct set of different limitations. This kind of thing is always difficult to take
apart but I think that, at least sometimes, those limitations have inspired me.
They definitely effected the way my music sounded, that much I can tell you is
for sure. 

One way that I like to think about these frameworks is with the word _project_.
Learning to play the guitar was a project. Learning to record myself playing the
guitar was another. Playing in a band came next. Learning to structure sound
together with friends sprung to life out of that. If we fast forward through all
of the links in the chain we arrive at the overarching project of organising
sound, and then, this particular example of that.

One fundamental difference between acoustic and electronic music is that
electronic music can be ungoverned by Newtonian forces. I think that is entirely
amazing. Any sound can arrive at any time. There need not be a sounding body or
physical object present in front of you. I hear someone in the back yelling
about speakers. Sure, sure, sure but we don't have to get stuck there.
Acousmatic music was a thing. I acknowledge that. No need to substitute one
fetichising of the corporeal with another as we go forward. The speaker is a
conduit, or put another way; a funnel. Thinking about it as a filter can be fun
but messy. What interests me the most is the stuff going through the funnel and
how to make it. 

**We are free**

Let's move on to what we are afforded from following the line of thinking that
we are free from the shackles of the finite and of the physical world. Sound now
enjoys morphological freedom through a myriad of transformations. It is
malleable to the utmost degree. We have at our disposal an astounding plethora
of tools through which to manipulate and organise sound. 

This thesis project is a collection of musical materials that explore the idea
of the uncanny valley as it relates to music being real, fake or some strange
combination of the two. This thesis project is primarily one in which I produce sound
files. In a secondary capacity I am also producing a text file.

In this text I aim to present some of my thoughts on how my work writing code
and making music might be connected in some hopefully interesting ways to my
field. I am unlikely to be able to adequately convey my own origin myth.
Instead I'll focus on stories I've been told about music, throughout my life,
inside and outside of academia. I have a strong suspicion that these stories
have shaped my coming into being as a composer. However difficult the task of
introspection, and ultimately to know one self proves to be, I at least regard
these stories as a source for clues as to why I am driven to do the things that
I do. 

**Who is speaking?**

I don't think that there can be anything like "The Self" without others
and that "The Self" is largely about imagining other's view of yourself.

Leslie Ervine PhD, University of Colorado, writes in her Qualitative Sociology
paper _Even Better Than The Real Thing_:

> One's stories persuade one's audience that one is a particular kind of person.
> When one is one's own audience, the telling amounts to having a self.[^Ervine]

What particular kind of person would I like to be? A Composer with a capital C!

> Good stories must meet several requirements. They must fulfil their audiences
> expectations for what counts as convincing. They must be coherent, drawing
> together disparate elements that end up seeming inherently related. They must
> make events seem to lead to one another. In addition, they must have satisfying
> endings - not happy endings, necessarily, but endings that provide resolution
> while leaving enough ambiguity to enliven listeners imaginations.[^Even]

This is how I think about this thesis project. I am doing just that drawing
together of disparate elements. Just like in a lot of music that is out there,
the sequence, or the order in which things are introduced, matters. A very
common trait of many musics that have been made is that they exist as a linear
experience. They are a form of artistic expression which exists within the time
domain. Compare music to sculpture. While this perhaps is not an entirely water
tight example I use it here because I use it all of the time, as anyone who
knows me can attest. I am guessing that it's important that I use it here in
order to maintain consistency. You get the idea.

> a U2 song, even better than the real thing. For listeners, stories make
> experiences possible that would, in real life, be impractical, dangerous,
> time-consuming, costly, or otherwise impossible.[^Even]

I define the criteria for what a good story as the following: A story
that I can remember and recount at a later time. Someone has told me a story and
I either like the story, or the person that told it to me, or both. I connect
the story to the person in my mind to varying degrees. Sometimes I end up
convinced that a particular person telling a particular story, at a particular
time, says something about what kind of person that person is, and other times
not. I think about all of the people that I have met coming up through music as
one person; Me. I was there every time someone told me a story. Those stories
undoubtedly came to shape the way I think about music and about organising
sound.

How to tell a story well is subjective or at least a matter of taste. I think
about functionality as a guide for constructing the story of the self. How
functional is it to include in the story a particular aspect with regards our
intended outcome? The intended outcome here is to arrive at a story which is
accessible and comprehensible. We want to understand each other. We are looking
for cues so that we can make better guesses about future behaviour. We are
looking for patterns. We are fundamentally geared for it. It is literally
hardwired into our senses. Pattern recognition is at the core of what it means
to have consciousness. Being as music's existence is dependent on hearing and
reasoning about what we hear I could say that musical form exploits this pattern
recognition aspect of consciousness to keep the listener engaged, and that that
might work with how you view the world, maybe.

**Why should we listen?**

That common goal, as I see it, is organizing sound. This makes us the same you
and I. Mostly everyone we know shares this common goal. I trace this way of
thinking about our common goal back to Edgard Varese talking about his own music
as organised sound. I am fine with that description. It is a very broad and
inclusive way of thinking about what we are doing, all of us together as a
group. I want to keep finding new answers to the question of how to organise
sound in ways that continue to interest me. Part of my staying interested is
engaging with other people who are also engaged in this same struggle. I want to
be part of a Community.

I've thought a lot about how to set myself up so that I become increasingly
unlikely to get bored. Cutting myself off from people increases the risk of
getting bored. Sharing my tools increases the likeliness of contact and/or
stimulating communication with other people.

In this text I don't just want to talk _at_ people about my internal state. I
genuinely want to try to make an honest attempt to make my thesis valuable to
others in terms of it's utility. This is why I've chosen to include the code I
used to make the music, as part of this text. My thinking here is that there
exists a certain kind of reader that won't want to sit through these touchy
feely meanderings unless there is a promise of some code that can be run at the
end of the day. For that reader: Here is that promise now.
 
I couldn't resist tying back sharing the code into this thesis project's narrative
framework as maps. You would be free to connect my code to anything you want and
control it. You could make your own connections to the things you care about.
Edit my code to find your own path through the valley. 

**What's wrong?**

Analogies are a special category of story. They are frail things. I don't
particularly care for them as I find that they too easily fall prey to being
contradicted by themselves as all of the things[^things] are fundamentally
different from each other. For example it doesn't work to say that gravity is
kind of like a rubber band pulling you back to the earth when you jump up. This
falls apart because the rubber band is also subjected to gravity within that
analogy.  When analogy is used to describe domains that we kind of "know" are at
least a little fuzzy and or subjective like emotions and ways of thinking
poetically about the world then I think that can be understood as something akin
to a shorthand and receives a passing grade. Now, with all that in mind, here
comes an analogy: Certain sonorities always made me feel like I was on the
outside of a locked door. Which sonorities I am refering to here is largely
exemplified in the music I made for this thesis project. You really should start
listening to the music if you haven't already.

MIT guide to Lock Picking: 

> ...it is worth pointing out that lock picking is just one way to bypass a lock,
> though it does cause less damage than brute force techniques. In fact, it may
> be easier to bypass the bolt mechanism than to bypass the lock. It may also be
> easier to bypass some other part of the door or even avoid the door entirely.
> Remember: There is always another way, usually a better one.[^MIT]

Having picked the lock or otherwise bypassing it (perhaps metaphysically walking
through walls) I find myself inside of this most coveted room. Inside the room
are a bunch of fancy instruments that can be computer controlled. It is an
amazing room and I am very happy that I can enter into it whenever I want and
spend as much time there as I like. No one ever comes into the room to say:

"Who the hell are you? You can't be in here touching these ~~instruments~~
priceless museum pieces!  _Security!!_"

I am in a safe space now and that feels good. The thing that feels even better
is that I got in by thinking about how I could gain access using the tools
available to me. Boom! I fixed my problem. I don't have a problem anymore. I
should be happy now right? Nope. That's not how this works. I find struggle
wherever I go. I keep going. Trying new things.

Here is an example of the frailty I was talking about earlier. You wouldn't be
particularly well served by bringing the wrong map with you on a hiking trip in
the woods. That wouldn't be poetic, you would just regret it. I much prefer
diagrams to analogies. So much more serious seeming and they have that sweet,
sweet science feel to them.

**The Cyber is huge**

Trying to make sense of what music making is, and also, what subsequent publishing as
"cybernetic practice" even means, all seems very difficult, so let's use a tool to help
us do that thinking.

Stephen Willats is a British artist who has self-published _Control magazine_,
a seminal forum for artists´ writings on art practice and social organization
since 1965. I'm going to let Willats walks us through the diagram and I'll
add some thoughts in between:

> This diagram shows the position an art work traditionally occupies between the artist
> and his audience. Two fundamental discrete loops are shown, which are
> isolated from each other by the art work. There is no form of interaction
> between the two which could generate mutual understanding as would be the case
> in a successful conversation. In the absence of such a procedure both the
> audience and artist become locked in their own perceptual biases.[^Willats]

The audience views the result of the artist's process of composing the work and
then goes on about their lives. Both artists and the audience go on to make and
experience new artworks. The arrows keep on going up forever like on a conveyor
belt infinitely churning out new artworks to be experienced. Some particular
work by some particular artist may resonate more with some individual human
being held within the mass that is the audience. The prescribed modus operandi
for this individual is then to take an interest in the artist, or rather the
story that has been constructed about the artist. To be neatly consumed, perhaps
in the form of a biography or an interview. I don't think this model serves us
very well. At least not on it's own.

> I wanted to look at all means of communication within society to take what I
> could from everywhere I could, and reformulate it into a new way of
> operating.[^Willats]

This makes me think of sampling as an act which holds potential to be radically
instrumental both in reevaluating not just intellectual property laws but the
very concept of property itself. 

> I wanted to intervene in the fabric of society directly. Not just sit inside a
> box, but to move freely within the interpersonal infrastructure of society. To
> create the means of people transforming their own sense of reality and identity
> and vision of the future.[^Willats]

If we were to share our code, the audience would be more likely to be empowered
to do something other than to continue to go about their lives as consumers.
Consumers of musics and of stories about artists. Perhaps idolizing them.
Putting the artist and subconsciously the idea that they themselves as part of
an audience (which is wholly separate from the artist) could create something,
anything.

> The outcome that I was interested in was the idea of self-organization.
> Transformation in the self, or creative potential of the self, so that anybody
> could create their own being in relation to other people. I was interested in
> society. I see that there's a richness in relationships between people,
> community.[^Willats]

I think self-organization as Willats uses it above is problematic because it
could be misconstrued as the invisible hand of the market which needs to be left
alone forever in order to self-organize supply and demand of goods and services.
Luckily for me there is a license that explicitly negates that. It's GPLv3.  The
specific transformation in the self that I'm aiming at changing is attitudes
towards constructed narratives designed to create cult followings. They are not
helping to deepen the audience's relationship with the artwork. Giving the
audience access to the GPLv3 licensed code on The Public Internet might not do
that all of the time but it is a thing to try instead of going along with a
prescribed method mindlessly. 

> ... there was an interconnection between the audience, the language, the meaning,

I've had a bunch of experiences prior to working on this thesis project. I have made
and heard a whole lot of music. Not only that but basically everything that has
ever happened to me and the things that I have come to believe, about myself and
about the world, I take with me into this new project. That happens with every
project. The framework surrounding this particular project really make me very
aware of that. Same thing goes for a listener. They also bring everything with
them into the act of listening. They might not know it but that's how it is.
Nothing happens in a vacuum. The two discrete loops of the artist and audience
are still kept separate in other necessary ways. I need to create music to keep
myself balanced but that doesn't mean that I surrender my privacy. The listener
shouldn't have to either. Privacy is a growing concern. Especially on the
internet.

Isis Agora Luvcruft, who at the time was a Core Developer of The Tor Project,
relates in ver[^Urticator] talk _Network Security - Anonymous Networks & Communications_ at Raboud University:

The Public Internet and the commercial internet are two very different places.
I thought for sure that once we got decent speeds going for most folks (yes, in
the global west, I know) we'd see some great stuff happening for distribution.
Self publishing web sites and genuine communication between all kinds of folks
leading to all kinds of profound new insights in all kinds of domains. Instead
we got social media and all kinds of really terrible things happening. Just
awful.

That is what the commercial internet looks like to me. I am so immensely
fatigued by it's "sad passions". The endless stream of strangers with perfectly
fake smiles has me wanting to never see another stranger's face ever again.
They're all so desperate to sell me everything I don't want. They probably
weren't even told what their faces were being used to sell. So unreal.

Max Read writes in _How much of the internet Is fake?_:

> ... through layers of diminishing reality.  
> ... half-awake, unable to distinguish the virtual from the real[^Read]

I'd now like to connect you back to earlier where I talked about how sampling is
something I think we would be well served to readdress in both thinking and
practice. The infrastructure we use for getting things done on The Public
Internet is something we need to look both forwards but also backwards in order
to make sense of. Social media platforms or any other part of the commercial
internet is not a part of that. If we were to build our own Public Internet
though, now that would really be something different all together! 

Brass tax nomenclature for increasing our freedoms relating to publishing our
work:

- Self published web sites
- RSS
- Email (lists)

These three apply to everyone. The last one below is most important to music makers
in general and myself in particular because I didn't have access to this
technology prior to this thesis project:

- A decent media player

When I say decent I mean that the audio quality needs to be decent (320kbs
constant bit rate for audio and video). I also mean that artists should be in
control of their own works and not supplying a platform with free "content" to
attract listeners which then get bombarded with atrocious ads. My wording here
now approaches questions of ethics and morality. You get the idea: Platforms
bad, self publishing good.

One last thing while we're adjacent to the topic of the internet in general. In
the Piratebay trial, Peter Sunde explained in his testimony:

> We don't use the expression IRL. We use AFK which means Away From Keyboard. We
> think that the internet is for real.[^Sunde]

<big>**02. On uncanniness**</big>

It can mean a lot of different things. 

Let's have a look in a dictionary[^Dictionary] just to get a broad sense of our bearings:

- Having or seeming to have a supernatural or inexplicable basis.  
- Beyond the ordinary or normal.  
- Extraordinary. 

"Uncanny accuracy; An uncanny knack of foreseeing trouble."

- Mysterious.  
- Arousing superstitious fear or dread.  
- Uncomfortably strange.  

"Uncanny sounds filled the house."    

Let me make an attempt at explaining why I am drawn to it. First off it strikes
me as contemporary, seeing as we are all living through post-truth, and secondly
because I regard it as largely unexplored when thought of as a musical
parameter. It turns out originality, or otherness, is important to me.

Uncanniness looks unexplored enough as a space to peek my interest. From where
I'm standing uncanniness being largely unexplored checks out as true. This
_perspective_ is something that I have created via the act of viewing and thinking
about the world. In our time of post-truth, simply having a thought, and then
remembering that one has had that thought previously, can lead one to thinking
that it is a true statement, on par with statements like: Gravity exists! At the time
of writing politicians at the highest levels behave in this exact way all of the
time. It is eerie how "manifestation" is everywhere now. Strange times indeed.

**An unexpected impact on choices**

All sample libraries  end up existng on a spectrum ranging from authentic
sounding to blatantly fictitious. It interests me to think about where a
particular library lands on that spectrum for an imagined listener. After that
there are aspects of how a library is recorded and scripted that influence me to
make all kinds of choices regarding the construction of the music. Dynamics and
registration most especially, but in some cases even pitch material has revealed
itself to me through this lens.  

It has been inspiring to read about Roboticist Masahiro Mori's
thoughts about _The Uncanny Valley_, and through
that finding Bunraku. It has impacted my view of the world and about how reality
is something we all hold together by reenacting. We are constantly reminding
each other of how to behave, what to regard as real, and what to discard as
unreal. Or as William Gibson put it in _Neuromancer_: 

> A consensual hallucination.[^Gibson]
>

Gibson was talking about something a little different when he wrote that. That's
part of what interests me about sampling. We can both refer to, and at the same
time recontextualize anything that has previously been recorded, either as sound
or as text. When we quote text we are bringing the context of academia at least
and perhaps even of The Enlightenment with us. We are standing on the shoulders
of giants. Literally all of recorded history. It has been kept safe for us so
that we might learn from it. With sampling of audio it's a little different.
Intellectual property laws forbid it. You would have to get permission from the
rights holders to distribute a derivative work. You would most likely have to
give away all of your potential profit to them. This "potentiality" however, is
shrinking rapidly. How will artists receiving fractions of pennies per stream
impact their their likeliness to sample? How will listeners having access to
"all" of the music ever recorded impact their likeliness to sample?

As my work of organizing sound has led me further and further down the path of
algorithmic composition, I have grown more and more interested in the role of
contexts and of connotations that certain sounds bring about in an audience
because of their potential to elicit a sense of the uncanny. 

I never really had any deeper context for LinnDrum Kicks or Four Operator FM
Synthesis. No contexts that I regarded as my own, except for the obvious context
that these sounds are strictly out of bounds for anyone looking to make
"serious" music. While that forbidden quality still holds some titillation I
have moved on to thinking that for the most part; No one cares. Don't worry.
This is a good thing. Trust me. It means that we are free. Free to dream
endlessly and to make anything we want. Any structure or intricate web of
references. Absolutely free.  Steve Martin wrote about this sense of freedom in
_LA Story_:

> ... no one is looking to the outside for verification that what they're doing
> is ok.[^LAstory]

**Fundamental differences**

Getting back to the practical; Certain things are different when sequencing
sounds in a computer. Sounds can be played faster. That's interesting because we
have that faster playing in music played by humans also. It's interesting
because a lot of the time it gets held up as virtuosic in different ways, within
different genres. We use phrases like gifted or talented musicians. A computer
can play _exactly_ the same amplitude and timbre multiple times in a row. Humans
can't, well actually the constraint is higher up than that. Simple physics
really, Newtonian forces won't allow it. We've never held that kind of
virtuosity up as equilibristic instrumentalist practice. I don't think we'd
react quite the same way if a human got even remotely close to that type of
musical capacity. "You sound like a machine" they'd say. It would be derogatory.
They might not even know what machine they'd be referring to. It would be the
sampler and more specifically an early days sampler with a single layer of
samples. No round-robin switching out of the samples to mimic what happens
"naturally" when a key is struck on a Steinway grand piano at different
velocities. An infinite amount of the subtlest variation explodes out of that
action each time. The cross talk inside the body of the instrument as multiple
keys are struck elevate the richness of timbral interplay to immeasurable
heights of exponentiality. The sampler is different is all I'm saying. It has
it's own behaviour. If we try hard, we can have a unique relationship to this
"new" instrument, that has nothing to do with that Steinway grand piano. We
would have to do the admittedly difficult work of adjusting our way of thinking
about the world in order to achieve this goal.

**The notion of The Real**

I find my own thinking aligning with these parts of Slavoj Zizek's in _The
Reality of the Virtual_. 

> ...when I deal with you, I'm basically not dealing with the real you. I'm
> dealing with the virtual image of you. And this image has reality, in the sense
> that it, none the less, structures the way I am dealing with you. And then
> this idealization is crucial.[^Zizek]

I substitute the interactions of two individual human beings with an audience's
experiencing of an artwork from two sides of it. More on these two sides of an
artwork later. I agree that idealization is crucial within this thesis project as well.
Had there not been this idealized view of acoustic instruments active in the
world, then there would be no foundation for me to build my castles in the sky
upon. I am trying to relate to my surroundings somehow, by creating these works.

> This would be the first elementary level: Imaginary virtual, in the sense of
> the virtual image which determines how we interact with other people. Virtual
> image in the sense of: Although we interact with real people, we erase, we
> behave as if whole strata of the other person are not there.[^Zizek]

I here substitute "real people" with artworks and "the whole strata" as the
process which has led to the result that is the artwork; The file. The .wav 
or .pdf for example. Process and method or even just the nomenclature of the
tools involved are per default hidden or purposefully made secret.

> [An] example of how the virtual dimension is operative at the symbolic level
> would have been beliefs. Are we aware to what extent our beliefs today are
> virtual? By virtual I mean, in this case, attributed to others, presupposed.
> They don't actually exist, they are virtual, in the sense that nobody really has
> to believe, we only have to presuppose another person to believe.[^Zizek] 

An example of a virtual symbolic belief in our neck of the woods would be the
story of how Gil Evans arranged _Sketches of Spain_. The story goes that he's a
genius for arranging in such a way that instruments that were very widely apart
in terms of their audibility, were they to be stood on a stage together, could
be made to fit snugly in a mix. Contrastingly there's the story of how a 1930s
first-timer studio musician asked a recording engineer "if there oughtn't be more
than one microphone in the room". The recording engineer then proceeds to laugh
and ask if the musician intends to record more than one record simultaneously?
The recording engineer goes on to explain that whomever in the ensemble has a
solo should take a step closer to the microphone. 

I presuppose that there is a person within an audience which listens to the
result of my organizing of sound filtered through these stories even tho I don't
regard them as real from my perspective. I imagine an audience's a priori
established beliefs subsequent effect on their perception of artworks that I
produce. 

In the music that I have produced for this thesis project the presupposition of the
imagined audience is that acoustic music is created by living breathing human
beings, reading sheet music. They are using a very special type of physical
object, which is a musical instrument, to make sounds. Ideally this happens in a
special type of physical space, which is a concert hall. This is how recordings
get made. The details surrounding the engineering aspect of the recording is not
important. The people in the room with their instruments; _That_ is where the
magic happens. Any infringement upon that fact is unthinkable, to this imagined
audience, which holds these virtual beliefs. This then becomes Zizek's
efficacity, as it gave me something to relate to when I made the music for this
project.

In the lead up to Zizek's great reveal of The Real Real there is the telling of
the story in which Rumsfeld lists what they knew at the time just before the war
on Iraq:

- The known knows
- The known unknowns
- The unknown unknowns

Zizek adds a fourth category to Rumsfeld's list: 

- Unknown knowns

> We know them, they are part of our identity, they determine our activity, but we don't
> know that we know them! This is what, in psychoanalysis, of course, is called
> unconscious. Unconscious fantasies, unconscious prejudices, etc., etc. And I
> think that this level is crucial.[^Zizek]

I agree that this level is crucial, and add that biases are another wording of
how these unknown knows dictate our behaviour. This wording strongly comes into
focus for me as an expression of our time. Especially as it relates to how
a wider applicability of algorithms in our daily lives has led to questions
being raised about algorithmic bias[^algorithmicBias]. Stating the obvious here
for the record: All of the algorithms created to date have been created by
humans. _We_ are the one's writing the algorithms. These are _our_ biases. We
bring them with us into everything we do. Even into the act of listening to
music. This is part of why I was drawn to exemplifying, or possibly even teasing
out these biases, or unknown knows, in the music I made in this thesis project.

I'll let Jacques Lacan speak for himself here via a quote from his seminar
_Freud's Papers on Technique_ in order to give you an example of why I find it
preferable to receive my Lacan through Zizek:

> The real is what resists symbolization absolutely.[^Lacan] 
>

I'll leave this section with an exercise for the reader, to be forever doomed,
just as I have been forever doomed to find Baudrillard's four categories from
_Simulation and Simulacra_, in every aspect of your life from now until
eternity:

- Faithful copy
- Mask
- Illusion
- Pure simulacrum

No, but seriously though, Corey Mohler asks:

> What is philosophy? 
> It's when you think about something so much that
> you actually end up understanding it less.[^Mohler]

When the simulation becomes indistinguishable from the real, and then, surpasses
the real in expressing the potential that was present all along, both in the
real and in the simulation. At that point, where the simulation extends past the
capacities of the real, and becomes preferred over the real, it can begin to
effect the real. Not to change the real, because the real is a moving target,
but better yet, to change the _enactment_ of the real. This enactment then
emanates outward, spreading like wildfire, approaching the point of critical
mass that is the wildly unruly expression of culture. 

You simply must see Emma Robinson's amazing video depicting a cover of Rihanna's
Stay using only her voice and a piano. Expert mimicry of Auto-Tune artifacts
using glottal stops and precise intonation inflections at on a dime speeds. Most
exquisite precision!

<big>**03. The MPC is now a lens**</big>

If the tape recorder was hyperReal then the MPC would be hyperHyperReal
(compare postPostModern) and controlling Kontakt with SuperCollider is
infinitely hyperRealised in comparison to the original origin myth.  

But we can't just run around slapping on an ever increasing number of post and
hyper to words all willy-nilly now can we? That would be ridiculous. Let's check in
with Mark Fisher in _Capitalist Realism_:

> Postmodernism remains a hugely contested term, its meanings, appropriately but
> unhelpfully, unsettled and multiple.[^Fisher]

**A new origin myth**

The myth of Electronic Music's origin, as it was handed down to me, was always
told through the perspective of the tape recorder being the unquestionable start
of it all. Then later, the result of that historical perspective sees the tape
recorder grow to the size of the studio with it's undeniable monumental
prestige. If we adjust the point of departure to a more recent technological
breakthrough then the scope of our story changes dramatically. To use the MPC as
the starting point for an alternative telling of history emerges as an
opportunity. If we dare to follow this line of thinking further we arrive at
taking actions in the present to create the kind of future we most prefer.

The story we now construct has ramifications for where density occurs within the
story. My preference is for density to occur closer to our time. Year zero is no
longer the end WWII with that of the Americans "liberating" the tape recorder from
the rubble of continental Europe. Instead, the year is 1988. Public Enemy burst
into a popular culture running at break-neck-speed with their debut release _It
Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back_. In _the same year_ N.W.A release
_Straight Outta Compton_.

Our origin story is no longer one of first meanderings of applying an alien
technology inside of a void. Instead the very modus operandi is referentiality.
The sampler and sampling, not the tape recorder and tape recordings. 

As stated above the history of Electronic Music begins with the tape recorder and then
_explodes_ outward into the physical monument of the studio. Our new origin story
is one of _implosion_. From the decisively physical 10,5 Kilos of the original
MPC-60 to the weightlessness of software. Both stories originate from a single
machine but constitutes wildly different points of departure.

Sampler software inside of computers are direct descendants of the MPC. They now
have no physical form. They are software. The computer disappears into
generalization. A computer can perform the task of any specialized machine like
the tape recorder or the sampler. A general purpose computer. Incorporeal.
Purpose defined in software.

**Over embellished symmetry**

It wasn't until much later that I realised that the "magical machine" that I had
heard about was the MPC. I first heard the story when I was a kid listening to
NWA, Public Enemy, De La Soul. Then finally when I was older from a friend who
turned me on to J-Dilla's _Donuts_. He told me the story of how the record got
made as we were listening to the album together. The last celebrated
experimental hip hop record and it didn't have _any_ rapping on it. The story
goes he made it in the hospital as he was dying of a terminal illness. Had his
MPC3000 on his belly in the hospital bed. I don't know if that's entirely
accurate. I guess I've put off trying to find out if it's a 100% true story
because

> A kiss may not be the truth but it's what we wish were true.
>[^LAstory]

That's another bit from Steve Martin's _LA Story_. In the film I think we're
meant to think it's a Shakespeare quote. I very much enjoy how in the film there
are all kinds of subtleties at work drawing lines between high and low
expressions of culture.

There might be a way to way to fit the John Cage on tour in Europe with Earl
Brown and Christian Wolff story in here. Bear with me here. The story goes that,
they were all on tour together, and their musics all utilized the idea that if
there is a sufficient amount of silence in between notes, then the listener will
forget the previous note. John Cage finds that after hearing the same program
being played night after night, in city after city, he begins to hear melodies
in all of their pieces. Prolonged exposure. Even just practice. It ends up in
your memory even if you don't want it to. Cage focused on just the notes in this
example. To my mind there would have still been the compounded infinities of
timbre and timing.  With the MPC in it's first iteration I'm thinking this was
most apparent. Hit that pad and get exactly the same sound every time. Later
models in my time have been marketed as having velocity through pressure
sensitivity built into the pads. Not sure but I think they returned to the flat
no dynamics thing when they made an iOS version. The MPC is then an expression
of acorporeality as Egan uses the word in _Diaspora_, reduced to pictures under
glass. The retriggering anyway, The "machineGunning". That's what I think became
what made the MPC so interesting to me in how it was perceived. Lifeless, or
even undead, like a zombie. The corpse moves, and in such marvellously different
ways.

**The old hat paradox**

Sampling as a radical act? Here then maybe the idea that there were
possibilities presented to artists in the past, in the form of a very special
brush, that for whatever reason have been insufficiently explored. Paradoxically
taking on the role of the old hat at the same time. FM certainly is like that.
Additive synthesis as well. These two examples can easily be thought of through
a purely technical perspective. Since both FM and additive synthesis offer an
apparent abundance in the parameter space it becomes a problem of organizing
efforts to explore them in powerful (abstracted) ways. We are left to our own
devices here. We are not posing a threat to anyone noodling around inside of
our belly buttons engaging with this work. On the other hand sampling isn't
comparatively as underexplored from a technical perspective. Might could be that
there could be a case to make about how sampling could be underexplored from a
_referential_ and_ social_ perspective. This is largely due to how fraught with
legal concerns sampling became. There was, I think, a panic that spread quickly.
A scrambling then ensued to safeguard intellectual property belonging to large
corporations.

**Curséd sampler** 

Meanwhile, a strange kind of cult following arose around the physical artefacts
that are the instruments themselves. Compare this to how the characteristics of
the instruments at the time we refer to as Early Music act on contemporary
practitioners within that expression. As these instruments are no longer in
production, the second hand market is of course where folks looking to live the
dream end up. The problem of sellers setting their wares apart from the rest
arises. The solution is now, as it always was, the narrative:

<big>**04. Code has value**</big>

Why do I feel it is important to include my code in this thesis? In a word:
Utility. I also feel that some degree of responsibility needs to be taken when
occupying a space and when speaking while one's voice is amplified by context.
That context in my case is academia. This is me owning up to the promise of not
surrendering to capitalist logic.

Mark Fisher had this to say in _Capitalist Realism_: 

> For most people under twenty in Europe and North America, the lack of
> alternatives to capitalism is no longer even an issue. Capitalism seamlessly
> occupies the horizons of the thinkable. Jameson used to report in horror about
> the ways that capitalism had seeped into the very unconscious; now, the fact

<big>**05. Pine cones are magical**</big>

While I don't believe in actual magic I find this
passage from Jarod Anderson's The CryptoNaturalist useful for purposes of
illustration:

> Pine cones are beautiful, geometric wonders that are only devalued by their
> abundance. Fractal sculptures. Evergreen snowflakes. Blossoms in wood.

I would like to return the shine, as it were, to the task of organising sound in
general and to working with algorithmic composition in particular. 
Stretch goals would be to influence people to join me in rewiring the term
Computer Music to hold a new meaning. One tailored specifically to fit our time.
As computers are no longer held in artificial scarcity but rather available in
abundance new ways of thinking and acting in the world are possible.

**The Believing Game**

I'd like to change your mind about everything you know in your heart of hearts
to be true. 

When I was a kid I would sometimes stare for long stretches of time
at high ceilings imagining what it would be like to be in that upside down world
in the ceiling. To walk around up there, looking up at the world down here. For
everything to be so different, about the way we perceive this place, where we
are now. You are reluctant to have your perspective changed. Your world views
are pretty much set. Let's play a game you and I. It's called: The Believing
Game.

Peter Elbow, Professor of English Emeritus at University of Massachusetts,
Amherst, writes in a draft for an essay entitled _The Believing
Game--Methodological Believing_: 

> I still struggle with how to name it. In my second essay, I tried a fancier more
> theoretically self-conscious term, calling it "methodological believing".
> But then I worried that this was needlessly pretentious--and I like the
> irreverence of "game". Yet now as I write this essay,
> "methodological" seems central.[^Elbow] 

> I can define the believing game most easily and clearly by contrasting it with
> the doubting game. Indeed, the believing game derives from the doubting game.[^Elbow]

> The _doubting game_ represents the kind of thinking most widely honored and taught

> In contrast, the _believing game_ is the disciplined practice of trying to be as

**Oram's New Atlantis** 

I keep coming back this passage from Francis Bacon's _The New Atlantis_ which was
first published in 1623:

> We have also sound-houses, where we practise and demonstrate all sounds, and
> their generation. We have harmonies which you have not, of quarter-sounds, and
> lesser slides of sounds. Divers instruments of music likewise to you unknown,
> some sweeter than any you have, together with bells and rings that are dainty
> and sweet. We represent small sounds as great and deep; likewise great sounds
> extenuate and sharp; we make divers tremblings and warblings of sounds, which in
> their original are entire. We represent and imitate all articulate sounds and
> letters, and the voices and notes of beasts and birds. We have certain helps
> which set to the ear do further the hearing greatly. We have also divers strange
> and artificial echoes, reflecting the voice many times, and as it were tossing
> it: and some that give back the voice louder than it came, some shriller, and
> some deeper; yea, some rendering the voice differing in the letters or
> articulate sound from that they receive. We have also means to convey sounds in
> trunks and pipes, in strange lines and distances.[^Bacon]

That's some story. Actually, for me it's a story wrapped in another story.
Daphne Oram put that quote on the wall at The BBC Radiophonic Workshop and
_that's_ the story I've been told.

Mark Fisher writes in _Capitalist Realism_:

> It was [the] BBC that also funded the popular avant gardism of the BBC
> Radiophonic Workshop, which embedded sonic experimentalism into everyday life.
> Such innovations are unthinkable now that the public has been displaced by the
> consumer.[^Fisher]

**Rooms are resonant bodies**

There is an absurdity and a poetic quality to our acts of imagining. I invite
you to imagine someone, at one time, having believed that a photograph, could
steal a soul.  

I've come to understand that my fascination for room tones in the form of
convolutions is connected to my confusion about my class identity. The first
time I experienced this is through working as a stage manager at
Norbergfestival's largest stage Mimer. I didn't realize it at the time how
profoundly it had effected me. And then later, The Machine Hall in Ställberg. It
was right under my nose then, but it took me quite a while to piece the puzzle
together. It's impossible for the narrative component of which space I use to
travel the distance to the listener on it's own. For me it's different. I know
the name of the convolution file. I can't help but imagine the workers there.
Through a wrinkle in time. Working, ceaselessly, dutifully. Now that the
lightning has been caught in the bottle, I can't help but imagine the work that
once filled those rooms with sound. From the lowest rumbles through the spectrum
all the way up the ladder to the harshest height of the audible spectrum. At the
end of it we subtract time and we've captured if not the room itself then it's
essence, or if you care to indulge me, it's soul. My fascination has been
focusing in on trying to pin down the work that happened there. It can't be
saved for later and understood given enough time. My own origin myth will always
elude me. "If these walls could talk" we say. My thoughts connect disparate
elements, and make patterns.  Compare another cavernous room tone; The church. A
place of worship. A place to wonder in awe of god's greatness. The organ was the
first big organised sound.  That room is part of how we've heard that
instrument. The resonance. Place and narrative intersect in the tone of the
room. As the room resonates _we_ are brought into resonance with _ideas_. I
never believed in god. I never believed in that narrative. I know work, was, at
least at one time, real.  The workers were real. Their struggle was real. I
believe in that narrative.

**State is immeasurable**

This subheader alludes to the observer effect in Physics where attempting to
make measurements invariably leads to changes in the situation or phenomenon you
are observing. Live Coding is at once both a situation and somewhat of a
phenomenon. Here's an excellent example of [live
coding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiEq_h5UQJM)

In this thesis project my code is static. This stands in contrast to how things
are done within Live Coding. Why is that important? A frozen state, that holds
the capacity to yield a multitude of infinities, expressed in immeasurable
variation as the intricate clockwork diligently passes through time. That sort
of thing fascinates me. It always has. To construct something and then for it to
take on a life of it's own in a sense. That feels paradoxical doesn't it? This
then goes on to say something interesting about complexity. Namely that the
scope, or, put another way, the sampling window, matters when we aim to assess
complexity. 

Is it static or is it in flux? I guess it also has something to do with the
presentation aspect of the work. I work on the code until it reaches a static
state which is most to my liking. While I might not listen to an eternity's
worth of the generated material, I'll listen to a good long while. I can be
certain that the algorithms combining of parameter values will continue to
satisfy me in the same way that I can hear when a piece is finished. My choice
to present static code in combination with fixed media is for the greater part
due to my fascination for complexity emerging out of simplicity. It's a feeling.
You'll have to take my word for the existence of that internal emotional state. 

**A differing perspective on smallness**

To a smaller degree it's also due to the fact that I can't help but go against
the prescribed modus operandi of playing the code, within Live Coding, like an
instrument. I'm like that a lot of the time. I just don't like being told what
to do I guess. 

I want to organise sound in a very specific way. To collapse the wavefront. To
affix the indefinite. To transform it into the definitive. Another nice aspect
of static code is that it greatly increases portability. This is important to
me.

I want to use code to compose. I don't want to play the code like an instrument.
I compare this to  preferring to compose over playing the guitar. Nothing wrong
with playing the guitar, I do that all of the time. I just prefer to compose is
all.

When I say "We're not ready for it", I don't mean that Live Coding is so
futureWorld that it, as a "cultural phenomenon", is ahead of it's time. It has
in fact existed for quite some time, although that is all very dependent on how
you define the criteria. What I'm saying is that we don't have the fundamentals
of the infrastructure for even just the creation of the kind of files that can
be distributed in a way that makes sense. Video is a really bad way of making
code available to others. The recipient can't copy the code out of the video
file and has to try to write it by hand. This is error prone and clunky. Also
video file sizes are huge. Static code however is just a tiny text file.
Kilobytes. Goes anywhere fast because it is so tiny. David and Goliath. There's
another story for you, and you know how that one turned out.

I got to thinking about state a lot through brushing up against functional
programming. In functional programming state is thought of as something dirty
and dangerous. That, of course, makes it interesting to me. I found workarounds
because it was fun to go against prescribed ways of working. It's that thing
from before about limitations within frameworks again. Also I'd argue that
memory is a fundamental aspect of music as it is a time based medium. You simply
can not say stuff like "There is no state", or that "Time is the only constant"
and not expect people to rise up in rebellion to dethrone and kill you, burn
down your church and take a leak on the ashes while laughing like a raving
lunatic. This is just how the world works. Tough cookies.

Anyway the whole "wanting to stay 100% squeaky clean all of the time thing",
that can happen to functional programmers, always struck me as having more to do
with fundamental problems in computer science, than about me wanting to organise
sound. Never mind about all of that. I don't mind so much that there could
potentially be a danger of some unexpected behaviour when I'm making music by
writing code. I spend a lot more time _listening_ to musical results than I do
expecting to hear things. So as long as it makes a sound there is something for me
to hear, and most importantly, to decide what I think of it. I only ever
regarded unintended silence as failure. Anything above that is something I can
work with. If I can hear it, I am certain that I can decide if I like it or not.
How could I not have an opinion on anything and everything I hear? As far back
as I can remember that's all I've been doing. Deciding. Making choices based on
what I've been hearing. So it's real simple. I like simple. So does Mark Fell,
and I like Mark Fell:

> It's all dead simple, I have no real interest in technical complexity, and this
> music has a streamlined quality I admire. No gesture is strained or wasted and
> the music is complex, the technology is simple, a better way round than the age
> old problem of academic electronic music where muscular technology too often
> produces pissweak sounds.[^Fell]

If I try hard I can still remember that the task of organising sound felt
daunting to me in the beginning. I would think about the infinite possibilities
of combinatorics and a general dread of the blank page would sneak up on me and
I'd get all wound up. I like to keep things simple. Usually I don't notice that
I've started composing for real until much later. I thought I was just trying to
figure out how something worked. I change one thing at a time, and I listen. If
I like what I hear, having tweaked that one parameter, I'll move on to the next
one. Complexity could yield itself later through the compounding of many simple
choices. I don't go after complexity. I don't shy away from it either. It could
happen and that would be ok so long as I like what I'm hearing. Simple. Reduced
both in terms of thinking about emergence of complexity and also about the work
as just another craft. Do a thing many times in order to get apt at doing
that thing.

<big>**06. Music is a technology**</big>

The title of this section is a remix of Anthony Rother's 2005 album _Art is a
technology_. I liked that album. Apart from the way it sounded, and how that made
me feel, I liked it because it was at once the most prominent example of "Modular
Music" that I have ever heard, and at the same time managed to transcend the genre
entirely. I like it when albums do that.

My first concious choice at the inception of this thesis project was that I
wrote code in order to make all of the pieces. This was important to me because,
like I said, I want to actively participate in recontextualizing the term
Computer Music. This term comes from a time where computers where rare, and the
utilizing of this scarce resource towards the goal of making music was even
rarer. At the time of this writing computers are ubiquitous (in the global west,
I know, add it to [The List](tiny.cc/e2x84y)).

**Putting on a show**

On April 6th of 2019, at Fylkingen, which is the national venue for weird music,
in Stockholm, Sweden, I premiered a bunch of music that I had made during the last year
or so. I made a lot of little choices about the details surrounding this
manifestation of the work. This compounding of little choices is very important
to me. You've heard the expression "The Devil is in the details". I subscribe to
that idea fully.

There were three sets. I've been a part of putting together a lot of shows at
Fylkingen, in a lot of different capacitites and, I have found that this format is
my preference. Each set was 40 minutes, and there were two 20 minute breathers in
between the sets. I find that this makes it doable from a technical perspective.
Longer, and or more, sets are not my preference within this "Fylkingen Show"
framework.

I choose to do the show on a Saturday afternoon. My thinking there was that, I
wanted it to be possible for a person who works a full time job, with regular
hours, to attend. I chose the afternoon instead of the default evening time
because I didn't want to have the bar open. The reason I didn't want to have the
bar open is because I don't drink. Also I didn't want to sell anything. Not that
day. I find that the default behaviour of everyone drinking at shows is not
conducive to listening. There is also the larger issue of sustainability. 

Mark Fisher writes in _Capitalist Realism_

> The significance of Green critiques is that they suggest that, far from being
> the only viable political-economic system, capitalism is in fact primed to
> destroy the entire human environment. The relationship between capitalism and

Destructive behaviour like the use of depressants like alcohol is not
sustainable, and obviously toxic, despite of what our culture dictates. So instead
of selling alcohol, I treated my audience to the same green tea and fruit that
had sustained me through the completion of this thesis project. If you ask me, I
thought that was a nice touch.

More importantly (what could be more important than Sencha?) the sound files I
created where all Stereo sound files. They were diffused in a larger speaker
array by Mats Erlandsson in the most exquisitely subtle way imaginable. The width
of the Stereo files were enhanced and the music really came to life and filled
the room. Mats tailored the colour (EQ), and amplitude of each component piece, to
the particular responses of the room. The sound files were accompanied by
projection of the code I used to make the particular piece.

Especially in the first set, I felt the need to do some "onBoarding" (intentional
use of gratuitous business jargon), so I did it using excerpts from this text,
read by speech synthesis. I spent way to much time on giving these virtual
voices "direction". I suspect that the underlying technology is concatenative
synthesis so in a lot of ways it has the same kind of characteristic "tells"
that playing back a limited set of samples of instruments does. Just like with
the music I found myself wanting to navigate this topography of "tells". I made
decisions about whether I wanted to go with, or against the input from the voices
I used. Should I allow the actors to "give the game away"? Do I add or subtract
from the sense that theses voices were something more complicated than just
plain old boring vanilla, _real_.

While working with the resultant sounds from having giving these virtual actors
"direction", through the use of special charcters that the speech synthesis
engine responds to in order to shorten or extend pauses, lessen or intensify
emphasis etc. I began to anthropomorphize uncontrollably. It was a trip. While
on the subject of trips, here's an account which was related to me after the
show by a member of the audience. This person had at first thought that I was on
the stage, then realized that it was a fake head, then become convinced that it
had moved. Then, she said with eyes widening, the silhouette had changed the ear
into a nose and the face from a man's to a woman's. It was just a backlit
styrofoam head draped in a black veil. In the absence of visual stimuli we start
to see things that are not there. It may be due to feedback in the pattern
recognition part of our brains, who can know these things?

American theoretical physicist Richard Feynman reminds us to exercise caution
when fawning over science in _The Pleasure of Finding Things Out_:

> ... statements of science are not of what is true and what is not true, but
> statements of what is known with different degrees of certainty.[^Feynman]

**Briefly on the subject of recording sound**

Take your fingers right up to your ears. As close as you can get them without
touching your ears. Now rub your fingers together ever so gently. You can hear
that can't you? Now imagine trying to hear such a faint sound across from a
concert hall or even just a stage. You would not be able to. Now imagine an
orchestra. Something close to a hundred people. They wouldn't be able to fit
there with all of their instruments in that close proximity where you heard that
faint sound of your fingers rubbing together just now. Right there is where I
put the microphone. Each time, as close as I can get it. It's the place were a
lover whispers to you. For each instrument and sometimes even changing the
placement to optimize fully for a particular articulation. We are taught that
close proximity is dangerous and can lead to an exaggerated low end. I have
found that it is easier and sounds better to subtract from a signal rather than
to add to it. Anyone who knows me knows that I have a strong preference for the
lower end of the audible spectrum. If need be, cut the bass and add any room
you like later, in post. Get as much of the signal as you can when you have it
in front of you. Just make sure it doesn't clip, is the kicker though.

**Uroboros's clenched jaw**

Leading up to the show I, of course, started to feel more and more agonizingly
pressed for time, as is always the case with me. I began to realize that I had
complicated matters many times over the course of the project by wanting both
the text and the music to be referential to each other in various ways. It
became the age old problem of Catch 22. The text needed to already be finished
in order for me to bring myself to finish the music and, vice versa. The myth of
Uroboros sprang to mind. I could neither stop time, nor step out of it. No
matter how I struggled with Uroboros's clenched jaw, I could not pry it open.
When all of this was at it's worst I began to loose my grip on what has always
been most important to me. The _conceptual_ had begun to effect the
_perceptual_. I got all wound up in thinking about my music that my music
started to sound like shit to me. It was very frustrating and I had to delete a
bunch of music because I felt it was posturing, and utterly lost in the
intoxication of constructivist beauty.

William S. Burroughs would have us believe that the source for this quote

Taken from Burroughs's _Minutes to Go_. 

This quote keeps popping up all over the pace. Later on in a video game called
Assassin's Creed. Everyone is sampling it. The origin is more blurred by every
use of it. It especially effects searchability on the commercial internet as the
search engine (you know which one, the dominant one) is "optimizing" by finding
and fanning flames into resonances. When a resonance becomes feedback it can be
used as a new signal to replace the old one. True origins are being overwritten.

Preferences of style exist, aesthetics do not. Just as there is no god there can
be no divine beauty. We are left to our own devices down here. We have to make
up our own minds about what we prefer. Not much else to it really.

So the gist of this text is this: During my Master which was 2017 to 2019 I
changed my way of working with music in a few different ways. A big part of it was
changing some of the tools I use. New tools, new capabilites, new _freedoms_. I
regard nomenclature as an important first step towards transparency. So here's a
quick recap of what has changed:

- I went from using TidalCycles to using SuperCollider as the language. <br>
- From using SuperDirt as my sampler to instead using Kontakt.<br> 
- From using AudioMulch to using Reaper for real time post production.<br> 

So some of the names of the tools changed but the functionality broadly speaking
stayed the same. The modus operandi is still:

- Write code, that triggers samples.
- Then, apply effects in some kind of DAW-like environment.

This is what I do, in order to express my musical ideas. Why should I express my
musical ideas? Because I want to, and because I can. The possibility exists and
I am drawn to it. The way I make music is dependant on tools. The tools should
be open for others to study and use. If I don't take measures to make my tools
available to others then I see myself kicking out the rungs beneath me as I
climb upward. I can't bear that. This is a process which has not fully reached
it's end state. I am embarrassed by my dependence on commercial software. It
should all be open source by now, but, it isn't. I make excuses, none of which
are any good, for why I am not fully open source. My most commonly used excuse
is that I am pressed for time.

On a conceptual or extra musical level I am obliged to admit, however
reluctantly, that something changed. Anyone who knows me is always hearing me
tell the same story. About how fundamentally music is incapable of depicting
anything because of the fact that it is inherently abstract and utterly
ephemeral. If someone _does_ tell a story, I keep saying, it's usually because
they are selling something. One of my favourite stories is the one about how
Vivaldi was a publisher. In Vivaldi's time, sheet music was the product. The
story goes that Vivaldi was able to sustain himself as an artist because he was
so good at also being a publisher who knew how to sell sheet music. What Vivaldi
had figured out, is that narrative sells. The alleged evidence for this is that
Vivaldi had already tried and failed to sell the music he later collected as The
Four Seasons. This story above all cements for me the unlikeliness that
programme music will be real. It will most likely be a marketing ploy to peddle
goods of some kind. 

Despite of how many times I have told that story both to myself, to my friends
and basically anyone within earshot, I ended up making a strange kind of
programme music myself. I got to thinking, perhaps too much, about my
environment, and about the people I met there. How they work, and also about why
they work in the ways that they work, and ultimately, what their goals are. The
project ended up describing my thoughts and emotions about being back in that
old world. Feeling much the same way as before. Like a prole at a cocktail
party, trying to blend in, eating cucumber hors d'oeuvres and failing to
exchange pleasantries, sweating profusely, certain of being found out and
politely asked to leave, any second now. 

I've come to realize that most of all, this thesis project was about learning to
cope with cognitive dissonance.

I've learned a lot from working on this thesis project. It's been very freeing
in a lot of ways. I feel like I "got over myself", in at least some respects. It
is my feeling that I addressed and was able to power through some issues. I am
very grateful for the oppourtunity to do so. I spent a lot longer than I usually
do coming back to pieces, adding to, and changing things. I know that doesn't
matter though. What I mean to say is: No one can ever hear how long any piece of
music took to write. How much effort went into making it. How much struggle. How
many demons overcome. Sound is just wiggly air. It is also my favourite thing to
do with the time that I have. Also I don't think I'm hurting anyone. So that's
what I'm doing. Making the air wiggle in a particular way that interests me,
here, in The Right Now. 

This isn't my last rodeo. Even though I definitely got entirely carried away
with this thesis project and it kind of blew up on me, I'd hate to ever have to
go through the experience of outside pressure to stay on brand. Compare
type-casting in film. An equivalent example would be the type-casting of Steve
Reich as The Quintessential American Minimalist. The trick here is to imagine
Reich as happy. Just like how we do with Sisyphus.

**My Last Rodeo**

What would My Last Rodeo be like? I imagine a decidedly more musical equivalent
to the ending of _Diaspora_ but with the same premise. The point at which time's
passing is no longer a threat. It would be _way_ better than indefinite lifespan
to be entirely certain of safety. The ultimate safe space is all encompassing.
That would mean collecting all of the energy from all of the suns, probably
using something like [Dyson Spheres](tiny.cc/rava5y). All of the mass within our
light cone would have been turned into [Computronium](tiny.cc/aova5y) at this
point. 

Eventually there would be world building. Creating universes is a tall ask.
Maybe we could try utilizing quantum entanglement applied to black holes as a
starting point for computation. Throw one bit in the hole and keep the other bit
for measurement. It would be a start anyway. It would have to be worked out.
Large tasks like this one wouldn't be at all different to smaller tasks. With
time out of the equation, me and who ever else was interested would pool our
energy allotments and, just keep grinding until it was done.

These universes then would have to be filled with the initial conditions
necessary for conciousness to emerge. That would keep me busy for a while I
think. Next would be tweaking those initial conditions until I started hearing
some interesting results. It would be a substantially larger parameter space
than the one I enjoyed exploring in this thesis project. I look forward to this
challenge.

This is my favourite story about the future. Stories about the future are a
special category of story. I included it because I want you to be certain of my
foreseeing working on all kinds of different projects, in between this one and,
My Last Rodeo.

Thank you for reading. That is all.

Below here are some materials I have gathered in an attempt to make things
easier for the kind of person who is curious about sources. Here's the thing
about the internet: It's fickle and frail. "Bit rot" is an ever increasing
likelihood. What I mean by that is that, I have taken steps to ensure that the
things I link to, will deliver on the content I wanted to link to. Archive.org's
WayBack Machine is a great tool for this kind of thing. It's been around since
2001. What it does is let you make a snapshot of what a web page looked like, at
a certain point in time. It is possible to have many snapshots, so you could
potentially describe how a website changed as time progressed through the eons.

Another, related strategy, that I have utilized in order to increase the
likelihood of the availability of outside materials, is .pdf files. Pdfs are
great. They can do a lot of stuff. They'll let you embed fonts. They also
support links and all kinds of other neat stuff that kind of make them like web
pages. There's one important difference to web pages though. They are one
consolidated file containing everything, so that makes them extremely portable.

Portability is a big thing for me. That's why, when it has been possible, I have
have made a copy of the .pdf and stored it in a place that I know that I can
without fail, trust. The links below that end with .pdf will let you download
your own copy of that .pdf. Every copy is a new original because it's digital.
The more copies of a file there are, the more likely it is to survive the [heat
death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_aOIA-vyBo) of the universe. I think
[UbuWeb](https://www.ubu.com) said it best:

> If you love something. download it, it might not be there forever.[^ubuweb]
> 

There are other links below. I've done these on a case by case basis where the
goal has been to keep you safe and shielded from commercial forces in general
and sites that track you in particular. For example, in the instances where I
have linked to birdSite I have made use of a tool called
[textise.net](https://www.textise.net/) which transforms any web page into
exclusively text. A .txt file can not track you and algorithmically tailor ads
to sell you things you don't need. If you have ever visited birdSite the
textised version might look a little weird at first but, you get used to it. Most
importantly, the text that I have quoted is preserved there, in a way that is
harmless to you. As an added bonus it is significantly less data-intensive and no
longer a dopamine-fueled candy-land of bright colours and blinking lights
devouring your soul when you are at your most weak.

At the time of writing I am still researching a way to _perfectly_ implement
Richard Stallman's vision of all users right to filter their experience on the
internet. I'll walk you through what I have put together so far.

[Brave](https://brave.com/) is an open source browser that is an ok option right
out of the box for filtering, or put another way, customizing our experience on
the internet.

Brave allows you to use an extension called 
[uBlock origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en),
which is designed to protect you from ads.

uBlock origin allows you to use a custom list of elements contained within web
pages to block.

You can download the custom list that I have prepared for you [here](uBlockList.txt).
This list makes it possible for you to view these sources the way that I would
prefer that you view them.
