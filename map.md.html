<big>**01. Establishing a baseline**</big>    

Let's start simple. I like simple. In this text I am going to be citing other
texts. I am citing other texts partly because I think that it is a thing that
people do when they write master theses. The other part of why I'm citing other
texts is because it reminds me of sampling. I am interested in sampling. We'll
get to why I think sampling and subsequently citing other texts in this thesis
is interesting but for now it's important to me that you know why I cite. I do
it because in my mind I am actually playing back a sample. It's a sample
containing text instead of sound. You are now ready to receive my first citation.

Steve Martin wrote the script for _LA Story_ and in that film he also plays the
main character Harris K. Telemacher who addresses his unrequited love this way: 

> All I'm saying is that, when I'm around you, I find myself showing off, which
> is the idiot's version of being interesting.[^LAstory]

When I am citing other texts I am not doing it to try to impress you. I am not
saying that I think anyone else's way of doing this is bad or anything. All I'm
saying is that, when I'm writing this, I find myself performing and, in that
performing, relating to ideas I have about other people's expectations. Long
story short; I guess you could say I have issues. These issues are mine. It's
not you, it's me.

Greg Egan writes in _Diaspora_:

> Every orphan was an explorer, sent to map uncharted territory. And every orphan
> was the uncharted territory itself.[^Diaspora]

You knew this already, but all of the quotes that I use can be traced back to
their origins. There you would find the complete body of work of their
creator. We're establishing a baseline here remember? I included the above quote
because it's from my favourite book. The reason it is my favourite book is
because it is a complete recounting of all of our yet unlived communal future,
as a utopia. I like to think that this says something about me and also about my
sensibilities. We could keep playing it this way. My liking something could be a
basis for inclusion. You might be able to piece together something towards an
understanding of my influences this way. 

Karl Marx writes in _Theses on Feuerbach_: 

> The philosophers have only _interpreted_ the world in various ways ; the point,
> however, is to _change_ it.[^Feuerbach]

The above quote tells you for sure that I am at least a socialist, if you hadn't
picked up on that vibe prior to this explicit evidence. It also says something
about how I'm fond of the idea that any pattern can be broken. Anything and
everything is subject to change. The "world" here is dependent on the scope we
apply to it. You can have your pick here whether or not it is literal as in the
planet's impending demise due to capitalism-induced climate disaster and
subsequent resource wars, _or_ given the terrifying nature of that particular
avenue of thought you might prefer one of the smaller scopes, e.g. The
Enlightenment, Academia, Artistic Research within new music, etc. 

**Public Service Announcement**

I should state that I'm not attempting to put forth rigorous proof of anything.
An example of an open problem requiring rigorous proof would be something like
"Can there be a logical solution to the creation of benevolent General
Artificial Intelligence under provably safe conditions?" That would be a
Computer Science paper. This text, although not directly engaged in the
prodction of scientific knowlege,does however aim to be of _use_. More on
utility later. That would probably happen on a Doctoral level (or above even?).
This is not that. This is artistic research and as such a single collapsing of a
wavefront within a form of expression which is not yet fully formed and still
coming into being. There is quite a bit of wiggle room here and I intend to make
ample use of it because, as we'll come back to, freedoms and liberties interest
me. 

I've been a composer for a while now. I've been involved with music in a lot of
different ways through the course of getting to where I'm at now, in this
moment, that has me writing this text. There have been different frameworks at
different times and those different frameworks have all come bundled with their
own distinct set of different limitations. This kind of thing is always difficult to take
apart but I think that, at least sometimes, those limitations have inspired me.
They definitely affected the way my music sounded, that much I can tell you is
for sure. 

One way that I like to think about these frameworks is with the word _project_.
Learning to play the guitar was a project. Learning to record myself playing the
guitar was another. Playing in a band came next. Learning to structure sound
together with friends sprung to life out of that. If we fast forward through all
of the links in the chain we arrive at the overarching project of organising
sound, and then, this particular example of that.

One fundamental difference between acoustic and electronic music is that
electronic music can be ungoverned by Newtonian forces. I think that is entirely
amazing. Any sound can arrive at any time. There need not be a sounding body or
physical object present in front of you. I hear someone in the back yelling
about speakers. Sure, sure, sure but we don't have to get stuck there.
Acousmatic music was a thing. I acknowledge that. No need to substitute one
fetichising of the corporeal with another as we go forward. The speaker is a
conduit, or put another way; a funnel. Thinking about it as a filter can be fun
but messy. What interests me is the stuff going through the funnel and how to
make it. 

**We are free**

Let's move on to what we are afforded from following the line of thinking that
we are free from the shackles of the finite and of the physical world. Sound now
enjoys morphological freedom through a myriad of transformations. It is
malleable to the utmost degree. We have at our disposal an astounding plethora
of tools through which to manipulate and organise sound. 

This thesis project is a collection of musical materials that explore the idea
of the uncanny valley as it relates to music being real, fake or some strange
combination of the two. This project is primarily one in which I produce sound
files. In a secondary capacity I am also producing a text file.

In this text I aim to present some of my thoughts on how my work writing code
and making music might be connected in some hopefully interesting ways to my
field. I am unlikely to be able to adequately convey my own origin myth.
Instead I'll focus on stories I've been told about music, throughout my life,
inside and outside of academia. I have a strong suspicion that these stories
have shaped my coming into being as a composer. However difficult the task of
introspection, and ultimately to know one self proves to be, I at least regard
these stories as a source for clues as to why I am driven to do the things that
I do. 

**Who is speaking?**

I don't think that there can be anything like "The Self" without others
and that "The Self" is largely about imagining other's view of yourself.

Leslie Ervine PhD, University of Colorado, writes in her Qualitative Sociology
paper _Even Better Than The Real Thing_ (2000):

> One's stories persuade one's audience that one is a particular kind of person.
> When one is one's own audience, the telling amounts to having a self.[^Even]

What particular kind of person would I like to be? A Composer with a capital C!

> Good stories must meet several requirements. They must fulfil their audiences
> expectations for what counts as convincing. They must be coherent, drawing

> while leaving enough ambiguity to enliven listeners imaginations.[^Even]

This is how I think about this thesis. I am doing just that drawing together of
disparate elements. Just like in a lot of music that is out there, the sequence,
or the order in which things are introduced, matters. A very common trait of many
musics that have been made is that they exist as a linear experience. They are a
form of artistic expression which exists within the time domain. Compare music
to sculpture. While this perhaps is not an entirely water tight example I use it
here because I use it all of the time, as anyone who knows me can attest. I am
guessing that it's important that I use it here in order to maintain
consistency. You get the idea.

I define the criteria for what a good story is to me as the following: A story
that I can remember and recount at a later time. Someone has told me a story and
I either like the story, or the person that told it to me, or both. I connect
the story to the person in my mind to varying degrees. Sometimes I end up
convinced that a particular person telling a particular story, at a particular
time, says something about what kind of person that person is, and other times
not. I think about all of the people that I have met coming up through music as
one person; Me. I was there every time someone told me a story. Those stories
undoubtedly came to shape the way I think about music and about organising
sound.

How to tell a story well is subjective or at least a matter of taste. I think
about functionality as a guide for constructing the story of the self. How
functional is it to include in the story a particular aspect with regards our
intended outcome? The intended outcome here is to arrive at a story which is
accessible and comprehensible. We want to understand each other. We are looking
for cues so that we can make better guesses about future behaviour. We are
looking for patterns. We are fundamentally geared for it. It is literally
hardwired into our senses. Pattern recognition is at the core of what it means
to have consciousness. Being as musics existence is dependent on hearing and
reasoning about what we hear I could say that musical form exploits this pattern
recognition aspect of consciousness to keep the listener engaged, and that that
might work with how you view the world, maybe.

**Why should we listen?**

That common goal, as I see it, is organizing sound. This makes us the same you
and I. Mostly everyone we know shares this common goal. I trace this way of
thinking about our common goal back to Edgard Varese talking about his own music
as organised sound. I am fine with that description. It is a very broad and
inclusive way of thinking about what we are doing, all of us together as a
group. I want to keep finding new answers to the question of how to organise
sound in ways that continue to interest me. Part of my staying interested is
engaging with other people who are also engaged in this same struggle. I want to
be part of a Community.

I've thought a lot about how to set myself up so that I become increasingly
unlikely to get bored. Cutting myself of from people increases the risk of
getting bored. Sharing my tools increases the likeliness of contact and/or
stimulating communication with other people.

In this text I don't just want to talk _at_ people about my internal state. I
genuinely want to try to make an honest attempt to make my thesis valuable to
others in terms of it's utility. This is why I've chosen to include the code I
used to make the music, as part of this text. My thinking here is that there
exists a certain kind of reader that won't want to sit through these touchy
feely meanderings unless there is a promise of some code that can be run at the
end of the day. For that reader: Here is that promise now.
 
I couldn't resist tying back sharing the code into this project's narrative
framework as maps. You would be free to connect my code to anything you want and
control it. You could make your own connections to the things you care about.
Edit my code to find your own path through the valley. 

**What's wrong?**

Analogies are a special category of story. They are frail things. I don't
particularly care for them as I find that they too easily fall prey to being
contradicted by themselves as all of the things[syntax] are fundamentally different from
each other. For example it doesn't work to say that gravity is kind of like a
rubber band pulling you back to the earth when you jump up. This falls apart
because the rubber band is also subjected to gravity within that analogy. 
When analogy is used to describe domains that we kind of "know" are at least a
little fuzzy and or subjective like emotions and ways of thinking poetically
about the world then I think that can be understood as something akin to a
shorthand and receives a passing grade. Now, with all that in mind, here comes an
analogy: Certain sonorities always made me feel like I was on the outside of a
locked door. Which sonorities I mean are largely exemplified in the music I made
for this project.

MIT guide to Lock Picking: 

> ...it is worth pointing out that lock picking is just one way to bypass a lock,
> though it does cause less damage than brute force techniques. In fact, it may
> be easier to bypass the bolt mechanism than to bypass the lock. It may also be

> Remember: There is always another way, usually a better one.[^MIT]

Having picked the lock or otherwise bypassing it (perhaps metaphysically walking
through walls) I find myself inside of this most coveted room. Inside the room
are a bunch of fancy instruments that can be computer controlled. It is an
amazing room and I am very happy that I can enter into it whenever I want and
spend as much time there as I like. No one ever comes into the room to say:

"Who the hell are you? You can't be in here touching these ~~instruments~~
priceless museum pieces!  _Security!!_"

I am in a safe space now and that feels good. The thing that feels even better
is that I got in by thinking about how I could gain access using the tools
available to me. Boom! I fixed my problem. I don't have a problem anymore. I
should be happy now right? Nope. That's not how this works. I find struggle
wherever I go. I keep going. Trying new things.

Here is an example of the frailty I was talking about earlier. You wouldn't be
particularly well served by bringing the wrong map with you on a hiking trip in
the woods. That wouldn't be poetic, you would just regret it. I much prefer
diagrams to analogies. So much more serious seeming and they have that sweet,
sweet science feel to them.

**The Cyber is huge**

Trying to make sense of what music making is, and also, what subsequent publishing as
´cybernetic practice´ even means, all seems very difficult, so let's use a tool to help
us do that thinking.

Stephen Willats is a British artist who has self-published _Control magazine_,
a seminal forum for artists´ writings on art practice and social organization
since 1965. I'm going to let Willats walks us through the diagram and I'll
add some thoughts in between:

> This diagram shows the position an art work traditionally occupies between the artist
> and his audience. Two fundamental discrete loops are shown, which are
> isolated from each other by the art work. There is no form of interaction
> between the two which could generate mutual understanding as would be the case
> in a successful conversation. In the absence of such a procedure both the
> audience and artist become locked in their own perceptual biases.[^Willats]

The audience views the result of the artist's process of composing the work and
then goes on about their lives. Both artists and the audience go on to make and
experience new artworks. The arrows keep on going up forever like on a conveyor
belt infinitely churning out new artworks to be experienced. Some particular
work by some particular artist may resonate more with some individual human
being held within the mass that is the audience. The prescribed modus operandi
for this individual is then to take an interest in the artist, or rather the
story that has been constructed about the artist. To be neatly consumed, perhaps
in the form of a biography or an interview. I don't think this model serves us
very well. At least not on it's own.

> I wanted to look at all means of communication within society to take what I
> could from everywhere I could, and reformulate it into a new way of
> operating.[^Willats]

This makes me think of sampling as an act which holds potential to be radically
instrumental both in reevaluating not just intellectual property laws but the
very concept of property itself. 

> I wanted to intervene in the fabric of society directly. Not just sit inside a
> box, but to move freely within the interpersonal infrastructure of society. To
> create the means of people transforming their own sense of reality and identity
> and vision of the future.[^Willats]

If we were to share our code the audience is more likely to be empowered to do
something other than to continue to go about their lives as consumers. Consumers
of musics and of stories about artists. Perhaps idolizing them. Putting the
artist and subconsciously the idea that they themselves as part of an audience
(which is wholly separate from the artist) could create something, anything.

> The outcome that I was interested in was the idea of self-organization.
> Transformation in the self, or creative potential of the self, so that anybody
> could create their own being in relation to other people. I was interested in

> community.[^Willats]

I think self-organization as Willats uses it above is problematic because it
could be misconstrued as the invisible hand of the market which needs to be left
alone forever in order to self-organize supply and demand of goods and services.
Luckily for me there is a license that explicitly negates that. It's GPLv3.  The
specific transformation in the self that I'm aiming at changing is attitudes
towards constructed narratives designed to create cult followings. They are not
helping to deepen the audience's relationship with the artwork. Giving the
audience access to the GPLv3 licensed code on The Public Internet might not do
that all of the time but it is a thing to try instead of going along with a
prescribed method mindlessly. 

> ... there was an interconnection between the audience, the language, the meaning,
> the intention, and the context and presentation. This meant that the strategies

I've had a bunch of experiences prior to working on this project. I have made
and heard a whole lot of music. Not only that but basically everything that has
ever happened to me and the things that I have come to believe, about myself and
about the world, I take with me into this new project. That happens with every
project. The framework surrounding this particular project really make me very
aware of that. Same thing goes for a listener. They also bring everything with
them into the act of listening. They might not know it but that's how it is.
Nothing happens in a vacuum. The two discrete loops of the artist and audience
are still kept separate in other necessary ways. I need to create music to keep
myself balanced but that doesn't mean that I surrender my privacy. The listener
shouldn't have to either. Privacy is a growing concern. Especially on the
internet.

The Public Internet and the commercial internet are two very different places.
I thought for sure that once we got decent speeds going for most folks (yes, in
the global west, I know) we'd see some great stuff happening for distribution.
Self publishing web sites and genuine communication between all kinds of folks
leading to all kinds of profound new insights in all kinds of domains. Instead
we got social media and all kinds of really terrible things happening. Just
awful.

That is what the commercial internet looks like to me. I am so immensely
fatigued by it's "sad passions". The endless stream of strangers with perfectly
fake smiles has me wanting to never see another stranger's face ever again.
They're all so desperate to sell me everything I don't want. They probably
weren't even told what their faces were being used to sell. So unreal.

Max Read writes in _How much of the internet Is fake?_:

> ... through layers of diminishing reality.  
> ... half-awake, unable to distinguish the virtual from the real[^Read]

I'd now like to connect you back to earlier where I talked about how sampling is
something I think we would be well served to readdress in both thinking and
practice. The infrastructure we use for getting things done on The Public
Internet is something we need to look both forwards but also backwards in order
to make sense of. Social media platforms or any other part of the commercial
internet is not a part of that. If we were to build our own Public Internet
though, now that would really be something different all together! 

Brass tax nomenclature for increasing our freedoms relating to publishing our
work:

- Self published web sites
- RSS
- Email (lists)

These three apply to everyone. The last one below is most important to music makers
in general and myself in particular because I didn't have access to this
technology prior to this project:

- A decent media player

When I say decent I mean that the audio quality needs to be decent (320kbs
constant bit rate for audio and video). I also mean that artists should be in
control of their own works and not supplying a platform with free ´content´ to
attract listeners which then get bombarded with atrocious ads. My wording here
now approaches questions of ethics and morality. You get the idea: Platforms
bad, self publishing good.

<big>**02. On uncanniness**</big>

It can mean a lot of different things. 

Let's have a look in a dictionary[^dictionary] just to get a broad sense of our bearings:

- Having or seeming to have a supernatural or inexplicable basis.  
- Beyond the ordinary or normal.  
- Extraordinary. 

"Uncanny accuracy; An uncanny knack of foreseeing trouble."

- Mysterious.  
- Arousing superstitious fear or dread.  
- Uncomfortably strange.  

"Uncanny sounds filled the house."    

Let me make an attempt at explaining why am I drawn to it. First off it strikes
me as contemporary, seeing as we are all living through post-truth, and secondly
because I regard it as largely unexplored when thought of as a musical
parameter. It turns out originality, or otherness, is important to me.

Uncanniness looks unexplored enough as a space to peek my interest. From where
I'm standing uncanniness being largely unexplored checks out as true. This
perspective is something that I have created via the act of viewing and thinking
about the world. In our time of post-truth, simply having a thought, and then
remembering that you have had that thought previously, can lead one to thinking
it is a true statement, on par with statements like: Gravity exists! At the time
of writing politicians at the highest levels behave in this exact way all of the
time. It is eerie how "manifestation" is everywhere now. Strange times indeed.

**An unexpected impact on choices**

All sample libraries exist on a spectrum ranging from authentic sounding to
blatantly fictitious. It interests me to think about where a particular library
lands on that spectrum for an imagined listener. After that there are aspects of
how a library is recorded and scripted that influence me to make all kinds of
choices regarding the construction of the music. Dynamics and registration most
especially, but in some cases even pitch material has revealed itself to me
through this lens.  

It has been inspiring to read about Roboticist Masahiro Mori's
thoughts about _The Uncanny Valley_, and through
that finding Bunraku. It has impacted my view of the world and about how reality
is something we all hold together by reenacting. We are constantly reminding
each other of how to behave, what to regard as real, and what to discard as
unreal. Or as William Gibson put it in _Neuromancer_: 

> A consensual hallucination.[^Gibson]
>

Gibson was talking about something a little different when he wrote that. That's
part of what interests me about sampling. We can both refer to, and at the same
time recontextualize anything that has previously been recorded, either as sound
or as text. When we quote text we are bringing the context of academia at least
and perhaps even of The Enlightenment with us. We are standing on the shoulders
of giants. Literally all of recorded history. It has been kept safe for us so
that we might learn from it. With sampling of audio it's a little different.
Intellectual property laws forbid it. You would have to get permission from the
rights holders to distribute a derivative work. You would most likely have to
give away all of your potential profit to them. This "potentiality" is shrinking
rapidly. How will artists receiving fractions of pennies per stream impact their
their likeliness to sample? How will listeners having access to "all" of the
music ever recorded impact their likeliness to sample?

As my work of organizing sound has led me further and further down the path of
algorithmic composition I have grown more and more interested in the role of
contexts and of connotations that certain sounds bring about in an audience
because of their potential to elicit a sense of the uncanny. 

I never really had any deeper context for LinnDrum claps or Four Operator FM
Synthesis. No contexts that I regarded as my own, except for the obvious context
that these sounds are strictly out of bounds for anyone looking to make serious
music. While that forbidden quality still holds some titillation I have moved on
to thinking that for the most part; No one cares. Don't worry. This is a good
thing. Trust me. It means that we are free. Free to dream endlessly and to make
anything we want. Any structure or intricate web of references. Absolutely free.
Steve Martin wrote about this sense of freedom in _LA Story_:

> ... no one is looking to the outside for verification that what they're doing
> is ok.[^LAstory]

**Fundamental differences**

Getting back to the practical; Certain things are different when sequencing
sounds in a computer. Sounds can be played faster. That's interesting because we
have that faster playing in music played by humans also. It's interesting
because a lot of the time it gets held up as virtuosic in different ways, within
different genres. We use phrases like gifted or talented musicians. A computer
can play _exactly_ the same amplitude and timbre multiple times in a row. Humans
can't, well actually the constraint is higher up than that. Simple physics,
Newtonian forces won't allow it. We've never held that kind of virtuosity up as
equilibristic instrumentalist practice. I don't think we'd react quite the same
way if a human got even remotely close to that type of musical capacity. "You
sound like a machine" they'd say. It would be derogatory. They might not even
know what machine they'd be referring to. It would be the sampler and more
specifically an early days sampler with a single layer of samples. No
round-robin switching out of the samples to mimic what happens "naturally" when
a key is struck on a Steinway grand piano at different velocities. An infinite
amount of the subtlest variation explodes out of that action each time. The
cross talk inside the body of the instrument as multiple keys are struck elevate
the richness of timbral interplay to immeasurable heights of exponentiality. The
sampler is different is all I'm saying. It has it's own behaviour. If we try
hard, we can have a unique relationship to this ´new´ instrument, that has
nothing to do with that Steinway grand piano. We would have to do the admittedly
difficult work of adjusting our way of thinking about the world in order to
achieve this goal.

<big>**03. The notion of The Real**</big>

I find my own thinking aligning with these parts of Slavoj Zizek's in _The
Reality of the Virtual_. 

> ...when I deal with you, I'm basically not dealing with the real you. I'm
> dealing with the virtual image of you. And this image has reality, in the sense
> that it, none the less, structures the way I am dealing with you. And then
> this idealization is crucial.[^Zizek]

I substitute the interactions of two individual human beings with an audience's
experiencing of an artwork from two sides of it. More on these two sides of an
artwork later. I agree that idealization is crucial within this project as well.
Had there not been this idealized view of acoustic instruments active in the
world, then there would be no foundation for me to build my castles in the sky
upon. I am trying to relate to my surroundings somehow, by creating these works.

> This would be the first elementary level: Imaginary virtual, in the sense of
> the virtual image which determines how we interact with other people. Virtual
> image in the sense of: Although we interact with real people, we erase, we
> behave as if whole strata of the other person are not there.[^Zizek]

I here substitute "real people" with artworks and "the whole strata" as the
process which has led to the result that is the artwork; The file. The .wav 
or .pdf for example. Process and method or even just the nomenclature of the
tools involved are per default hidden or purposefully made secret.

> [An] example of how the virtual dimension is operative at the symbolic level

> virtual? By virtual I mean, in this case, attributed to others, presupposed.
> They don't actually exist, they are virtual, in the sense that nobody really has
> to believe, we only have to presuppose another person to believe.[^Zizek] 

An example of a virtual symbolic belief in our neck of the woods would be the
story of how Gil Evans arranged Sketches of Spain. The story goes that he's a
genius for arranging in such a way that instruments that were very widely apart
in terms of their audibility, were they to be stood on a stage together, could
be made to fit snugly in a mix. Contrastingly there's the story of how a 1930s
first-timer studio musician asked a recording engineer ´if there oughtn't be more
than one microphone in the room´. The recording engineer then proceeds to laugh
and ask if the musician intends to record more than one record simultaneously?
The recording engineer goes on to explain that whomever in the ensemble has a
solo should take a step closer to the microphone. 

I presuppose that there is a person within an audience which listens to the
result of my organizing of sound filtered through these stories even tho I don't
regard them as real from my perspective. I imagine an audience's a priori
established beliefs subsequent effect on their perception of artworks that I
produce. 

In the music that I have produced for this project the presupposition of the
imagined audience is that acoustic music is created by living breathing human
beings, reading sheet music. They are using a very special type of physical
object, which is a musical instrument, to make sounds. Ideally this happens in a
special type of physical space, which is a concert hall. This is how recordings
get made. The details surrounding the engineering aspect of the recording is not
important. The people in the room with their instruments; _That_ is where the
magic happens. Any infringement upon that fact is unthinkable, to this imagined
audience, which holds these virtual beliefs. This then becomes Zizek's
efficacity, as it gave me something to relate to when I made the music for this
project.

In the lead up to Zizek's great reveal of The Real Real there is the telling of
the story in which Rumsfeld lists what they knew at the time just before the war
on Iraq:

- The known knows
- The known unknowns
- The unknown unknowns

Zizek adds a fourth category to Rumsfeld's list: 

- Unknown knowns

> We know them, they are part of our identity, they determine our activity, but we don't
> know that we know them! This is what, in psychoanalysis, of course, is called
> unconscious. Unconscious fantasies, unconscious prejudices, etc., etc. And I
> think that this level is crucial.[^Zizek]

I agree that this level is crucial, and add that biases are another wording of
how these unknown knows dictate our behaviour. This wording strongly comes into
focus for me as an expression of our time. Especially as it relates to how
a wider applicability of algorithms in our daily lives has led to questions
being raised about algorithmic bias[syntax]. Stating the obvious here for the record:
All of the algorithms created to date have been created by humans. _We_ are the
one's writing the algorithms. These are _our_ biases. We bring them with us into
everything we do. Even into the act of listening to music. This is part of why I
was drawn to exemplifying, or possibly even teasing out these biases, or unknown
knows, in the music I made in this project.

I'll let Jacques Lacan speak for himself here via a quote from his seminar
_Freud's Papers on Technique_ in order to give you an example of why I find it
preferable to receive my Lacan through Zizek:

> The real is what resists symbolization absolutely.[^Lacan] 
>

I'll leave this section with an exercise for the reader, to be forever doomed,
just as I have been forever doomed to find Baudrillard's four categories from
_Simulation and Simulacra_, in every aspect of your life from now until
eternity:

- Faithful copy
- Mask
- Illusion
- Pure simulacrum

No, but seriously though, Corey Mohler asks:

> What is philosophy? 
> It's when you think about something so much that
> you actually end up understanding it less.[^Mohler]

When the simulation becomes indistinguishable from the real, and then, surpasses
the real in expressing the potential that was present all along, both in the
real and in the simulation. At that point, where the simulation extends past the
capacities of the real, and becomes preferred over the real, it can begin to
effect the real. Not to change the real, because the real is a moving target,
but better yet, to change the _enactment_ of the real. This enactment then
emanates outward, spreading like wildfire, approaching the point of critical
mass that is the wildly unruly expression of culture. 

You simply must see Emma Robinson's amazing video depicting a cover of Rihanna's

using glottal stops and precise intonation inflections at on a dime speeds. Most

<big>**04. The MPC is now a lens**</big>

If the tape recorder was hyperReal then the MPC would be hyperHyperReal
(compare postPostModern) and controlling Kontakt with SuperCollider is
infinitely hyperRealised in comparison to the original origin myth.  

But we can't just run around slapping on an ever increasing number of post and
hyper to words all willy-nilly now can we? That would be ridiculous. Let's check in
with Mark Fisher in _Capitalist Realism_:

> Postmodernism remains a hugely contested term, its meanings, appropriately but
> unhelpfully, unsettled and multiple.[^Fisher]

The myth of Electronic Music's origin, as it was handed down to me, was always
told through the perspective of the tape recorder being the unquestionable start
of it all. Then later, the result of that historical perspective sees the tape
recorder grow to the size of the studio with it's undeniable monumental
prestige. If we adjust the point of departure to a more recent technological
breakthrough then the scope of our story changes dramatically. To use the MPC as
the starting point for an alternative telling of history emerges as an
opportunity.

The story we now construct has ramifications for where density occurs within the
story. My preference is for density to occur closer to our time. Year zero is no
longer 1930 with that of the Americans liberating the tape recorder from the
rubble of nazi Germany. Instead the year is 1988. Public Enemy burst into a
popular culture running at break-neck-speed with their debut release _It Takes
a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back_. Our origin story is no longer one of
first meanderings of applying an alien technology inside of a void. Instead the
very modus operandi is referentiality. The sampler and sampling, not the tape
recorder and tape recordings. 

The history of Electronische Musik begins with the tape recorder and then
explodes outward into the physical monument of the studio. Our new origin story
is one of implosion. Both stories originate from a single machine.  

Sampler software inside of computers are direct descendants of the MPC. They now
have no physical form. They are software. The computer disappears into
generalization. A computer can perform the task of any specialized machine like
the tape recorder or the sampler. A general purpose computer. Incorporeal.
Purpose defined in software.

It wasn't until much later that I realised that the magical machine that I had
heard about was the MPC. I first heard the story when I was a kid listening to
NWA, Public Enemy, De La Soul. Then finally when I was older from a guy who
turned me on to J-Dilla's _Donuts_. He told me the story as we were listening to the
album together. It was interleaved. The story was. It got interrupted by "oh oh
and check this part out". Little things about the production. Details. They say
the devil is in the details. Anyway I really got that story handed to me. The
last celebrated experimental hip hop record. Didn't have any rapping on it. The
story goes he made it in the hospital as he was dying of a terminal illness.
Had his MPC on his belly in the hospital bed. I don't know if that's true. I
guess I've put off trying to find out if it's true because I like the story.

> A kiss may not be the truth but it's what we wish were true.
>[^LAstory]

That's another bit from Steve Martin's _LA Story_. In the movie I think we're meant to
think it's a Shakespeare quote. I very much enjoy how in the film there are
all kinds of subtleties at work drawing lines between high and low expressions
of culture.

There might be a way to way to fit the John Cage on tour in Europe with Earl
Brown and Christian Wolff story in here. The story goes that they were all on
tour together and their musics all utilized the idea that if there is a
sufficient amount of silence in between notes then the listener will forget the
previous note. John Cage finds that after hearing the same program being played
night after night in city after city he begins to hear melodies in all of their
pieces. Prolonged exposure. Even just practice. It ends up in your memory even
if you don't want it to. Cage focused on just the notes in this example. To my
mind there would have still been the compounded infinities of timbre and timing.
With the MPC in it's first iteration I'm thinking this was most apparent. Hit
that pad and get exactly the same sound every time. Later models in my time have
been marketed as having velocity through pressure sensitivity built into the
pads. Not sure but I think they returned to the flat no dynamics when they
made an iOS version. The MPC is then an expression of  acorporeality as Egan
uses the word in _Diaspora_, reduced to pictures under glass. The
retriggering anyway. The "machineGunning". That's what I think became what made
the MPC so interesting in how it was perceived. Lifeless, or even undead, like a
zombie. The corpse moves, and in such marvellously different ways.

Sampling as a radical act? Here then maybe the idea that there were
possibilities presented to artists in the past (a very special brush) that for
whatever reason have been insufficiently explored. Paradoxically taking on the
role of the old hat at the same time. FM certainly is like that. Additive
synthesis as well. These two examples can easily be thought of through a purely
technical perspective. Since both FM and additive synthesis offer an apparent
abundance in the parameter space it becomes a problem of organizing efforts to
explore them in powerful (abstracted) ways. We are left to our own devices here.
We are not posing a threat to anyone noodling around inside of our belly buttons
engaging with this work. On the other hand sampling isn't comparatively as
underexplored from a technical perspective. Might could be that there could be a
case to make about how sampling could be underexplored from a referential and
social perspective. This is largely due to how fraught with legal concerns
sampling became. There was, I think, a panic that spread quickly. A scrambling
then ensued to safeguard intellectual property belonging to large corporations.

**CURSÉD SAMPLER:** 

Meanwhile, a strange kind of cult following arose around the physical artefacts
that are the instruments themselves. Compare this to how the characteristics of
the instruments at the time we refer to as Early Music is to contemporary
practitioners within that expression. As these instruments are no longer in
production, the second hand market is of course where folks looking to live the
dream end up. The problem of sellers setting their wares apart from the rest
arises. The solution is now, as it always was, the narrative:

The above ad text reproduced here in it's entirety taken from Seattle

anonymized) manages to make the no haggling over the price requirement an
integral part of the narrative itself.

<big>**05. Code has value**</big>

Why do I feel it is important to include my code in this thesis? In a word:
Utility. I also feel that some degree of responsibility needs to be taken when
occupying a space and when speaking while one's voice is amplified by context.
That context in my case is academia. This is me owning up to the promise of not
surrendering to capitalist logic.

Mark Fisher had this to say in _Capitalist Realism_: 

> For most people under twenty in Europe and North America, the lack of
> alternatives to capitalism is no longer even an issue. Capitalism seamlessly

<big>**06. Pine cones are magical**</big>

While I don't believe in actual magic I find this
passage from Jarod Anderson's The CryptoNaturalist useful for purposes of
illustration:

> Pine cones are beautiful, geometric wonders that are only devalued by their
> abundance. Fractal sculptures. Evergreen snowflakes. Blossoms in wood.
> (Familiarity can rust magic. A little mental effort returns the shine.)[^Anderson] 

I would like to return the shine, as it were, to the task of organising sound in
general and to working with algorithmic composition in particular. 
Stretch goals would be to influence people to join me in rewiring the term
Computer Music to hold a new meaning. One tailored specifically to fit our time.
As computers are no longer held in artificial scarcity but rather available in
abundance new ways of thinking and acting in the world are possible.

**The Believing Game**

I'd like to change your mind about everything you know in your heart of hearts
to be true. 

When I was a kid I would sometimes stare for long stretches of time
at high ceilings imagining what it would be like to be in that upside down world
in the ceiling. To walk around up there, looking up at the world down here. For
everything to be so different, about the way we perceive this place, where we
are now. You are reluctant to have your perspective changed. Your world views
are pretty much set. Let's play a game you and I. It's called: The Believing
Game.

**Oram's new Atlantis** 

I keep coming back this passage from Francis Bacon's The New Atlantis which was
first published in 1623:

> We have also sound-houses, where we practise and demonstrate all sounds, and
> their generation. We have harmonies which you have not, of quarter-sounds, and
> lesser slides of sounds. Divers instruments of music likewise to you unknown,
> some sweeter than any you have, together with bells and rings that are dainty
> and sweet. We represent small sounds as great and deep; likewise great sounds
> extenuate and sharp; we make divers tremblings and warblings of sounds, which in
> their original are entire. We represent and imitate all articulate sounds and
> letters, and the voices and notes of beasts and birds. We have certain helps
> which set to the ear do further the hearing greatly. We have also divers strange
> and artificial echoes, reflecting the voice many times, and as it were tossing
> it: and some that give back the voice louder than it came, some shriller, and
> some deeper; yea, some rendering the voice differing in the letters or
> articulate sound from that they receive. We have also means to convey sounds in
> trunks and pipes, in strange lines and distances.[^Bacon]

That's some story. Actually, for me it's a story wrapped in another story.
Daphne Oram put that quote on the wall at The BBC Radiophonic Workshop and
_that's_ the story I've been told.

Mark Fisher writes in _Capitalist Realism_:

> It was [the] BBC that also funded the popular avant gardism of the BBC
> Radiophonic Workshop, which embedded sonic experimentalism into everyday life.
> Such innovations are unthinkable now that the public has been displaced by the
> consumer.[^Fisher]

**Rooms are resonant bodies**

There is an absurdity and a poetic quality to our acts of imagining. I invite
you to imagine someone at one time having believed that a photograph could steal
a soul.  

I've come to understand that my fascination for room tones in the form of
convolutions is connected to my confusion about my class identity. The first
time I experienced this is through working as a stage manager at
Norbergfestival's largest stage Mimer. I didn't realize it at the time how
profoundly it had effected me. And then later, The Machine Hall in Ställberg. It
was right under my nose then but it took me quite a while to piece the puzzle
together. It's impossible for the narrative component of which space I use to
travel the distance to the listener on it's own. For me it's different. I know
the name of the convolution file. I can't help but imagine the workers there.
Through a wrinkle in time. Working, ceaselessly, dutifully. And now that the
lightning has been caught in the bottle I can imagine that work filling that
room with sound. From the lowest rumbles through the spectrum all the way up the
ladder to the harshest height of the audible spectrum. At the end of it we
subtract time and we've captured if not the room itself then it's essence, or if
you care to indulge me, it's soul. My fascination has been focusing in on trying
to pin down the work that happened there. It can't be saved for later and
understood given enough time. My origin myth will always elude me. ´If these
walls could talk´ we say. My thoughts connect things up and make patterns.
Compare another cavernous room tone; The church. A place of worship. A place to
wonder in awe of god's greatness. The organ was the first big organised sound.
That room is part of how we've heard that instrument. The resonance. Place and
narrative intersect in the tone of the room. As the room resonates we are
brought into resonance with ideas. I never believed in god. I never believed in
that narrative. I know work, was, at least at one time, real. The workers were
real. Their struggle was real. I believe in that narrative.

<big>**07. State is immeasurable**</big>

Explain the context about live coding and how shows are done here.

My code is static. Why is that important? A frozen state, that holds the
capacity to  yield a multitude of infinities, expressed in immeasurable
variation as the intricate clockwork diligently passes through time. That
fascinates me. It always has. To construct something and then for it to take on
a life of it's own in a sense. That feels paradoxical doesn't it? This then goes
on to say something interesting about complexity. The scope, or put another way,
the sampling window, matters. 

Is it static or is it in flux? It also has something to do with the
presentation aspect. I work on the code until it reaches a static state which is
most to my liking. While I might not listen to an eternity's worth of the
generated material, I'll listen to a good long while. I can be certain that the
algorithms combining of parameters will continue to satisfy me in the same way
that I can hear when a piece is finished. My choice to present static code in
combination with fixed media is for the greater part due to my fascination for
complexity emerging out of simplicity. It's a feeling. You'll have to take my
word for the existence of that internal emotional state. 

**A differing perspective on smallness**

To a smaller degree I can't help but go against the prescribed modus operandi of
playing the code, within so called ´live coding´, like an instrument. That is
not what I want to do. I want to organise sound in a very specific way. To
collapse the wavefront. To affix the indefinite. To transform it into the
definitive. Another nice aspect of static code is that it greatly increases
portability. This is important to me.

When I say "We're not ready for it". I don't mean that live coding is so
futureWorld that it, as a ´cultural phenomenon´, is ahead of it's time. It's
existed for quite some time, although that is all very dependent on how you
define the criteria. What I'm saying is that we don't have the fundamentals of
the infrastructure for even just the creation of the kind of files that can be
distributed in a way that makes sense. Video is a really bad way of making code
available to others. The recipient can't copy the code out of the video file and
has to try to write it by hand. This is error prone and clunky. Also video file
sizes are huge. Static code however is just a tiny text file. Kilobytes. Goes
anywhere fast because it is so tiny. David and Goliath. There's another story
for you, and you know how that one turned out.

I got to thinking about state a lot through brushing up against functional
programming. In functional programming state is thought of as something dirty
and dangerous. That, of course, makes it interesting to me. I found workarounds
because it was fun to go against prescribed ways of working. It's that thing
form before about limitations within frameworks again. Also I'd argue that
memory is a fundamental aspect of music as it is a time based medium. You simply
you simply can not say stuff like "There is no state", or that "Time is the only
constant" and not expect people to rise up in rebellion to dethrone and kill
you, burn down your church and take a leak on the ashes while laughing like a
raving lunatic. This is just how the world works. Tough cookies.

Anyway the whole ´wanting to stay one hundred percent squeaky clean all of the
time thing´ that can happen to functional programmers always struck me as having
more to do with fundamental problems in computer science than about me wanting
to organise sound. Never mind about all of that. I don't mind so much that there
could potentially be a danger of some unexpected behaviour when I'm making music
by writing code. I spend a lot more time listening to musical results than I do
expecting to hear things. So long as it makes a sound there is something for me
to hear, and, most importantly, to decide what I think of it. I only ever
regarded unintended silence as failure. Anything above that is something I can
work with. If I can hear it, I am certain that I can decide if I like it or not.
How could I not have an opinion on anything and everything I hear? As far back
as I can remember that's all I've been doing. Deciding. Making choices based on
what I've been hearing. So it's real simple. I like simple. So does Mark Fell,
and I like Mark Fell:

> It's all dead simple, I have no real interest in technical complexity, and this
> music has a streamlined quality I admire. No gesture is strained or wasted and
> the music is complex, the technology is simple, a better way round than the age
> old problem of academic electronic music where muscular technology too often
> produces pissweak sounds.[^Fell]

If I try hard I can still remember that the task of organising sound felt
daunting to me in the beginning. I would think about the infinite possibilities
of combinatorics and a general dread of the blank page would sneak up on me and
I'd get all wound up. I like to keep things simple. Usually I don't notice that
I've started composing for real until much later. I thought I was just trying to
figure out how something worked. I change one thing at a time, and I listen. If
I like what I hear, having tweaked that one parameter, I'll move on to the next
one. Complexity could yield itself later through the compounding of many simple
choices. I don't go after complexity. I don't shy away from it either. It could
happen and that would be ok so long as I like what I'm hearing. Simple. Reduced
both in terms of thinking about emergence of complexity and also about the work
as just another craft. Do a thing many times in order to get apt at doing
that thing.

<big>**08. Music is a technology**</big>

The title of this section is a remix of Anthony Rother's 2005 album _Art is a
technology_. I liked that album. Apart from the way it sounded and how that
made me feel I liked it because it was at once the most prominent example of
"Modular Music" I have heard and at the same time managed to transcend the genre
entirely.

On April 6th of 2019, at Fylkingen, in Stockholm, I premiered a bunch of music
that I had made during the last year or so. I made a lot of little choices about
the details surrounding this manifestation of the work. This compounding of
little choices is very important to me. You've heard the expression The Devil is
in the details. I subscribe to that idea fully.

My first concious choice was that I wrote code in order to make all of the
pieces. I want to participate in recontextualizing the term Computer Music.
This term comes from a time where computers where rare and the utilizing of this
scarce resource towards the goal of making music was even rarer. At the time of
this writing computers are ubiquitous.

There where three sets. I've been a part of a lot of shows and I have found that
this format is my preference. Each set was 40 minutes and there were two 20
minute breathers in between the sets. I find that this makes it doable from a
technical perspective. Longer and or more sets are not my preference within this
"Fylkingen Show framework".

I choose to do the show on a Saturday afternoon. My thinking there was that I
wanted it to be possible for a person who works a full time job with regular
hours to attend. I chose the afternoon instead of the default evening time
because I didn't want to have the bar open. The reason I didn't want to have the
bar open is because I don't drink. I didn't want to sell anything. I find that
the default behaviour of everyone drinking at shows is not conducive to
listening. There is also the larger issue of sustainability. 

Mark Fisher writes in _Capitalist Realism_

> The significance of Green critiques is that they suggest that, far from being
> the only viable political-economic system, capitalism is in fact primed to
> destroy the entire human environment. The relationship between capitalism and
> eco-disaster is neither coincidental nor accidental: capital's 'need of a

Destructive behaviour like the use of depressants like alcohol is not
sustainable and obviously toxic despite of what our culture dictates. So instead
of selling alcohol I supplied the same green tea and fruit that had sustained me
through the completion of the project. If you ask me, I thought that was a nice
touch.

More importantly (what could be more important than Sencha?) the sound files I
created where all Stereo sound files. They were diffused in a larger speaker
array by Mats Erlandsson. The width of the Stereo files were enhanced and the
music really came to life and filled the room. Mats tailored the colour (EQ) and
amplitude of each component piece to the particular responses of the room. The
sound files were accompanied by projection of the code I used to make the
particular piece.

**Briefly on the subject of recording sound**

Take your fingers right up to your ears. As close as you can get them without
touching your ears. Now rub your fingers together ever so gently. You can hear
that can't you? Now imagine trying to hear such a faint sound across from a
concert hall or even just a stage. You would not be able to. Now imagine an
orchestra. Something close to a hundred people. They wouldn't be able to fit
there with all of their instruments in that close proximity where you heard that
faint sound of your fingers rubbing together just now. Right there is where I
put the microphone. Each time, as close as I can get it. It's the place were a
lover whispers to you. For each instrument and sometimes even changing the
placement to optimize fully for a particular articulation. We are taught that
close proximity is dangerous and can lead to an exaggerated low end. I have
found that it is easier and sounds better to subtract from a signal rather than
to add to it. Anyone who knows me knows that I have a strong preference for the
lower end of the spectrum. If need be, cut the bass and add a any room you like
later, in post. Get as much of the signal as you can when you have it in front of
you. Just make sure it doesn't clip, is the kicker though.

William S. Burroughs would have us believe that the source for this quote
is:

Taken from Burroughs's _Minutes to Go_. 

This quote keeps popping up all over the pace. Later on in a video game called
Assassin's Creed. Everyone is sampling it. The origin is more blurred by every
use of it. It especially effects searchability on the commercial internet as the
search engine (you know which one, the dominant one) is "optimizing" by finding
and fanning flames into resonances. When a resonance becomes feedback it can be
used as a new signal to replace the old one. True origins are being overwritten.

Adam Phillips writes in _Missing out_ that:

> The only satisfactions available are the satisfactions of reality, which are
> themselves frustrating.[^Phillips]
 
Preferences of style exist, aesthetics do not. Just as there is no god there can
be no divine beauty. We are left to our own devices down here. We have to make
up our own minds about what we prefer. Not much else to it really.

So the gist of this text is this: During my Master which was 2017 to 2019 I
changed my way of working with music in a few different ways. Part of it was
changing some of the tools I use. I regard nomenclature as an important first step
towards transparency. So here's a quick recap of what has changed:

- I went from using TidalCycles to using SuperCollider. <br>
- From using SuperDirt as my sampler to instead using Kontakt.<br> 
- From using AudioMulch to using Reaper for real time post production.<br> 

So some of the names of the tools changed but the functionality broadly speaking
stayed the same. The modus operandi is still: 

- Write code, that triggers samples. 
- Then, apply effects in some kind of DAW-like environment.

This is what I do, in order to express my musical ideas. Why should I express my
musical ideas? Because I want to, and because I can. The possibility exists and
I am drawn to it. The way I make music is dependant on tools. The tools should
be open for others to study and use. If I don't take measures to make my tools
available to others then I am kicking out the rungs beneath me as I climb
upward. This is a process which has not fully reached it's end state. I am
embarrassed by my dependence on commercial software. It should all be open
source by now, but, it isn't. I make excuses, none of which are any good, for why
I am not fully open source. My most commonly used excuse is that I am pressed
for time.

On a conceptual or extra musical level I am obliged to admit, however
reluctantly, that something changed. Anyone who knows me is always hearing me
tell the same story. About how fundamentally music is incapable of depicting
anything because of the fact that it is inherently abstract and utterly
ephemeral. If someone _does_ tell a story, I keep saying, it's usually because
they are selling something. One of my favourite stories is the one about how
Vivaldi was a publisher. In Vivaldi's time, sheet music was the product. The
story goes that Vivaldi was able to sustain himself as an artist because he was
so good at also being a publisher who knew how to sell sheet music. What Vivaldi
had figured out is that narrative sells. The alleged evidence for this is that
Vivaldi had already tried and failed to sell the music he later collected as The
Four Seasons. This story above all cements for me the unlikeliness that
programme music will be real. It will most likely be a marketing ploy to peddle
goods of some kind. 

Despite of how many times I have told that story both to myself, to my friends
and basically anyone within earshot, I ended up making a strange kind of
programme music myself. I got to thinking, perhaps too much, about my
environment, and about the people I met there. How they work, and also about why
they work in the ways that they work, and ultimately, what their goals are. The
project ended up describing my thoughts and emotions about being back in that
old world. Feeling much the same way as before. Like a thief at a cocktail
party, trying to blend in, eating cucumber hors d'oeuvres and failing to exchange
pleasantries, sweating profusely, certain of being found out and politely asked
to leave, any second now. 

Most of all, this project was about learning to cope with cognitive dissonance.

I've learned a lot from working on this project. It's been very freeing in a lot
of ways. I feel like I "got over myself", in at least some respects. It is my
feeling that I addressed and was able to power through some issues. I spent a
lot longer than I usually do coming back to pieces, adding to, and changing
things. I know that doesn't matter though. What I mean to say is: No one can
ever hear how long any piece of music took to write. How much effort went into
making it. How much struggle. How many demons overcome. Sound is just wiggly
air. It is also my favourite thing to do with the time that I have. Also I don't
think I'm hurting anyone. So that's what I'm doing. Making the air wiggle in a
particular way that interests me, here, in The Right Now. 

This isn't my last rodeo. Even though I definitely got entirely carried
away with this project and it kind of blew up on me, I'd hate to ever have to go
through the experience of outside pressure to stay on brand. Compare
type-casting in film. An equivalent example would be the type-casting of Steve
Reich as The Quintessential American Minimalist. The trick here is to imagine
Reich as happy. Just like how we do with Sisyphus.

**My Last Rodeo**

What would My Last Rodeo be like? I imagine a decidedly more musical equivalent
to the ending of _Diaspora_ but with the same premise. The point at which time's
passing is no longer a threat. It would be _way_ better than indefinite lifespan
to be entirely certain of safety. The ultimate safe space is all encompassing.
That would mean collecting all of the energy from all of the suns, probably
using something like Dyson Spheres. All of the mass within our light cone would
have been turned into Computronium. Also I'd like some company. So that would be
world building. Creating universes is a tall ask. Maybe we could try utilizing
quantum entanglement applied to black holes as a starting point for computation.
Throw one bit in the hole and keep the other bit for measurement. It would be a
start anyway. It would have to be worked out. Large tasks like this one wouldn't
be at all different to smaller tasks. With time out of the equation, we'd just
keep grinding until it was done.

These universes then would have to be filled with the initial conditions
necessary for conciousness to emerge. That would keep me busy for a while I
think. Next would be tweaking those initial conditions until I started hearing
some interesting results. It would be a substantially larger parameter space
than the one I enjoyed exploring in this project. I look forward to this
challenge.

This is my favourite story that no one wants me to tell. I included it because
I want you to be certain of my foreseeing working on all kinds of different
projects in between this one and My Last Rodeo.

Thank you for reading. That is all.

**Below are unsorted snippets of random things**

If you are doing creative work then to some extent, sure, I think it could be a
good idea to try to write down some of your thoughts about the task at hand from
your perspective. 

What's that quote about how the originality of your ideas being dependent on
the obscurity of your sources?

What is the utmost of subtlety?

I remember the time in my life when as a teenager I would go to a record store
to listen to music and decide which CD I would buy. I could afford to buy one CD
per month. I was building my collection slowly this way. Then later because a
lot of strange and complicated reasons I started lend/leasing compressed files
through a platform. I did this through monthly subscription which coincidentally
is the same amount I paid for that one CD a month when I was a kid. They say you
can listen to any music through this platform but I know that's not true. The
platform being there and seeming so very unquestionable has led to people
attempting to game it. The blandest, most chill music is being made in the hopes
that it will be included in playlists marketed as containing the best music to
sleep to. The ultimate state of utility for music which is then to be unheard,
at least consciously. It would be there to sooth and lul you back to sleep if it
was interrupted perhaps is the thinking. When fractions of pennies per play are
offered to artists by the all encompassing platform then whole nights worth of
plays is where the money is. Especially when you multiply it by the platform
preferring to peddle the good that is the playlist by use of algorithms. The
data aggregated from the entirety of the platform's users dictates that this is
the most chill music to sleep to. The resonance is inevitable. Feedback
eventually rips everything apart. Ouroboros clenches it's own tail, spiralling
ever downward in convolution and the most chill unfelt agony that is never
learning of the great width and breadth of the provable infinite capacity for
variety that music holds.

Money pays salaries, funds nonprofits, buys art, funds grants. Does it matter
where it comes from? What makes certain money acceptable or not acceptable? Is
it: How it was made? Who it comes from? What is given in return? What it is
going towards? Our ethics and internal math may vary, but the question is
omnipresent.

Tell the story of how you heard as a child that the reason Hollywood scores in
general and strings in particular can sound so distinctly Hollywood is because
of the secret that they produce an amalgamy of the real and the fake. Forging the
two into a stronger material than either of the two on their own could ever be.
Perhaps even then I had the thought, or at least an ungraspable sense, without
knowing the word, inexpressible but profoundly experienced. The hyperReal.

The Daft punk story is crazy.
Everything was recorded onto analog tape in rarified recording palaces like New
York's Electric Lady and LA's Capitol Studios. Human spontaneity was coveted;
computers, with their tendency toward mindless repetition, were not.

“Technology has made music accessible in a philosophically interesting way,
which is great,” says Bangalter, talking about the proliferation of home
recording and the laptop studio. “But on the other hand, when everybody has the
ability to make magic, it's like there's no more magic — if the audience can just
do it themselves, why are they going to bother?”

Ryan Dombal's Daft Punk interview for Pitchfork that came out in May 2013 is
riddled with descriptions of the interviewees affluence. We are told a story of
success through appearances. I imagine the article had the opposite of the
intended effect on me. I love the idea of democratising the means of
production.

"Round Robins are a method of recording a number of performances of the same
sample so that when playing repeated notes in fast succession you don't get
“machine gunning” a rapid repeat of the same sample that gives the game away
immediately."

This quote taken from a SpitFire Audio manual for a percussion sample library.
If you decide to keep this then you should find it.

Richard Feynman quote [where?]:

> Statements of science are not of what is true and what is not true, but
> statements of what is known with different degrees of certainty.

All that can be heard is real. Only imaginings of sounds are unreal. Sonorities
yet to heard. There are fictions. Narratives exist. We live alongside our lores.
There are stories that we tell each other, and that we tell ourselves. Admitting
the impossibility in knowing even one self. Certainly not each other. Definitely
not culture. We are all choosing to live with these stories even as as we make
increasingly feeble attempts at that loftiest of goals of understanding,
all the more likely settling for ways to cope as we are strung along by each other.

I trace the story of the impossibility of viewing all of the stones held
within Ryōanji from any vantage point to John Cage.

Complexity must not be a goal in itself.   
Strive to increase utility of information. 

In the notion of the real talk about IRL and conversely AFK and the promise of
The Public Internet and how the commercial internet is not that Stallman dream.

The task at hand is mainly organising sound. My ambition is to present a number
of materials, both in thought and in music. In doing so I hope to "tune" the
listener's perception of the musical works held within the project through the
means of text in order to allow for the possibility of greater immersion. 

Music appreciation is subjective. Who'd a thunk it?

Every academic discipline is defined by the questions it chooses
to ignore.

**Notes**

I searched for the Varese quote in Libris. _We_ are the source. He never said
it. At least not those exact words in that sequence. I'll try to construct a spiel
about how matter how hard I try I can't make the sock-puppet say the exact words
in the exact sequanece I want it too.

The Enlightenment List of the scopes might be a bit much?

Do the hand wavey Algorithmic Composition Evangelism about exploring massive
parameter spaces without falling prey to confirmation bias because it was a lot of
work. Spending time making tools and then using those tools more than once. In
contrast making no tools, making everything bespoke for that piece and then at
the end of it the piece is done but then when you start again there's that blank
page staring back at you like before.

Be mindful about the difference between the overarching narrative that is my life
and what quite separately is the scope of this project.

Write about the chronology of events regarding the creation of the works within
the project.

Time needs to be fixed.

Provide .wav examples of Linn Drum and FM four operator samples.

Strive to connect things. Look for the connections backwards through the text.

Prove that you know what things are. Electronische Musik and Kontakt and
even SuperCollider?. What about writing to have my text be read by someone like
me? 

I think this was more about functional vs. OOP.

Mimer & the machine hall and the church feels unconnected still maybe even now?

Explain what liveCoding is. 

Explain the difference between functional programming and object oriented
programming.

Read The believing game again and decide where or not to include any of that.

Also Nick Srnicek's Demand the future.

Expensive gear is a barrier to entry.

The portability of a laptop is a necessity when life is precarious.

Seize the means of production here means: 

Don't get caught up in consumption! <br>
Use the laptop you found in the tech trash room! <br>
Write code! <br>
Share it! <br>

Make sure uses of affect and effect are correct

Philip K. Dick's "Counterfeit unrealites" is a collection of four novels.
Undoubtedly the most known of which is "Do androids dream of electric sheep"
which was later adapted into Blade Runner.

I'd like to try to fit the story of the Japanese poetry group around year 1000
who allowed each other to take new names every decade or so to start each decade
with a fresh voice. To become the resplendent new. The untainted eye. A new
voice through which to speak about new perspectives. As many times over as they
wished for as long as they lived and wrote. That story is maybe where I'd like
to go. To get to a point where I feel free to reinvent myself as an artist as
often as I like.   

In last part: 
Place: Make the case that a piece of code can be thought of as sculpture or as a
place. What are some examples of nice places? The stone garden is a nice story.
The shopping mall is another place. Not as nice a place I don't think. Then
again, I've never experienced a stone garden. The stone garden only exists in my
imagination through having been told stories.

Mark Fisher - Capitalist realism quotes: 

the suspicion that the end has already come, the thought that it could well be
the case that the future harbors only reiteration and re-permutation. Could it
be that there are no breaks, no 'shocks of the new' to come? Such anxieties tend
to result in a bi-polar oscillation: the 'weak messianic' hope that there must
be something new on the way lapses into the morose conviction that nothing new
can ever happen. The focus shifts from the Next Big Thing to the last big thing
- how long ago did it happen and just how big was it? 

So long as we believe (in our hearts) that capitalism is bad, we are free to
continue to participate in capitalist exchange. 

The protest impulse of the 60s posited a malevolent Father, the harbinger of a
reality principle that (supposedly) cruelly and arbitrarily denies the 'right'
to total enjoyment. This Father has unlimited access to resources, but he
selfishly - and senselessly - hoards them. Yet it is not capitalism but protest
itself which depends upon this figuration of the Father; and one of the
successes of the current global elite has been their avoidance of identification
with the figure of the hoarding Father, even though the 'reality' they impose on
the young is substantially harsher than the conditions they protested against in
the 60s.

We the audience are not subjected to a power that comes from outside; rather, we
are integrated into a control circuit that has our desires and preferences as
its only mandate - but those desires and preferences are returned to us, no
longer as ours, but as the desires of the big Other. Clearly, these circuits are
not confined to television: cybernetic feedback systems (focus groups,
demographic surveys) are now integral to the delivery of all 'services',
including education and government. This returns us to the issue of
post-Fordist bureaucracy. 

the most powerful forms of desire are precisely cravings for the strange, the
unexpected, the weird. These can only be supplied by artists and media
professionals who are prepared to give people something different from that
which already satisfies them; by those, that is to say, prepared to take a
certain kind of risk. 

It means recognizing that the goal of a genuinely new left should be not be to
take over the state but to subordinate the state to the general will. This
involves, naturally, resuscitating the very concept of a general will, reviving
- and modernizing - the idea of a public space that is not reducible to an
aggregation of individuals and their interests. 

Nevertheless, what did happen in 2008 was the collapse of the framework which
has provided ideological cover for capitalist accumulation since the 1970s.
After the bank bail-outs neoliberalism has, in every sense, been discredited.
That is not to say that neoliberalism has disappeared overnight; on the
contrary, its assumptions continue to dominate political economy, but they do so
now no longer as part of an ideological project that has a confident forward
momentum, but as inertial, undead defaults. 

Nothing is inherently political; politicization requires a political agent which
can transform the taken-forgranted into the up-for-grabs.

Think about making the track list as an appendix also maybe the code as an
appendix. 

Maybe use just the last piece of code as an example in the prose.

A more precise explanataion of what I've changed in Willats's Diagram.

Right cursive for Willats and Lacanianan

Code and even maybe track list as images with right centered cursive.

Make more airy readability by creating subheaders in The Cyber is Huge.

Expand your thinking on the pervasivness of The Platforms.

Weak subheader in Uncanniness.

Maybe expand Mark Fisher MySpace thinking in some kind of caveat about when he
wrote it.

foot notes on the page in the print version.

Every quote needs a little syntax number.

No <br> in paragraphs!

In On Uncanniness which dictionary.

Prove questions being raised about algorithmic bias by providing a few articles.

Add intro to State is immeasurable.

Export your diagrams to .pdf and revert to .md then use that to generate the
LaTeX.
